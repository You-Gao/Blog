    I like Bauhaus. A part of that is largely due to their design philosophy; which is "<em>objectivity</em>" mixed with humility. The art movement had a critique that it was too "<em>minimalistic</em>" and "<em>authoritarian</em>" to some extent. I don't disagree with the labels as that's the general trade-off when searching for "<em>universals.</em>"

    The above picture is of the "<em>Zollverein Coal Mine</em>" a UNESCO site.
