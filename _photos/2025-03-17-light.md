    I have a fascination with ceiling lights. They are our artificial suns, made to make our enclosed boxes feel like we are out in nature even when that is further from the truth. Some buildings use them well, some buildings not so well. It's archetypical, in a sense; the chandeliers, ceiling fans, led strips, "<em>modernist</em>", and what nots, say something about the place their found in.
