I periodically change my wallpapers throughout the seasons and curated wallpaper sites help in that process. This particular one is from [grafolio](https://grafolio.ogq.me/backgrounds). Other ones I look at are pinterest, but I mainly miss the chinese social media wallpaper sites that I think have been taken down.

Tangent, I now realize I forgot to publish a post about a movie I watched and a short discussion on how movies are "*disambiguated*". I don't feel like rewriting it, but I do feel that the movie is worth a watch so I'll link it here.
