    Pok√©mon has released a type of rarity called "<bold><em>IR</em></bold>" or "<bold><em>Illustration Rare</em></bold>" in their latest sets. They are "<bold><em>Full Art</em></bold>" drawings made by specific artists, and each usually has a specific style. They are pretty cool. I finally have a reason to collect some. I think the ratio of card collectors and actual card collectors has to be like 1000:1 at this point.
