# A Field Guide to Getting Lost

> Lost really has two disparate meanings. Losing things is about the familiar falling away, getting lost is about the unfamiliar appearing

As the book title says, it is all about getting yourself lost. Lost in the woods, Lost in culture, Lost in space, Lost in mind. Solnit writes to capture the concept of loss, how it applies metaphorically and physically, and reframes the deep power contained in getting lost. In doing so, she makes two key distinctions on loss. 

## Loss As Being

> You get lost out of a desire to be lost. But in the place called lost strange things are found

Loss as being, the ontoepistemological state of existence where the surroundings know more than you know of it. Where movement needs to be made with a skeptical caution, but nevertheless demands movement. Where the embodied experience is one of radical alertness and openness. Where you as a person come in contact with the strange things, new things, and ephemeral outlines.

Solnit is writing here to highlight the latent powers of being loss through what I dub the Dialectics of Orientation. The act of making yourself disoriented within an environment, system, or processes opens up futures, potentials and new paths. In other words, to find yourself, you must lose yourself first. A journey towards knowledge necessarily starts at **terra incognita** 

But, being loss is scary isn't it? The unknown has been a form of cultural horror found in The Twilight Zone to Black Mirror. There is the sense of unbearable ambiguity and foreshadowing doom in being loss. Solnit, however, tells us to not be afraid. Information and knowledge is always out there in the environment to help you find your way. 

> The lost are often illiterate in this language that is the language of the earth itself, or donâ€™t stop to read it.  

Explorers look at the stars, mathematicians look at previous axioms, and humanity has its stories. What she is trying to say is that we should all possess the necessary navigational tools or atleast slowly develop them before going out into the deep unknown. Like how throwing a 2nd grader into PHD physics would leave them utterly lost and how slowly building them up is the more sane option. But, without taking any risks at all, where does that leave you?

> For me, childhood roaming was what developed self-reliance, a sense of direction and adventure, imagination, a will to explore, to be able to get a little lost and then figure out the way back. I wonder what will come of placing this generation under house arrest.

## Loss as Thing

Loss as thing, the external object-focused state of existence. Something is lost if it is missing in the environment from the viewer. A phone, A opportunity, A body is missing. A piece of the supposed Gestalt whole breaks away into the void. And just as with being loss, Solnit writes on the merit of intentionally losing something.

Losing something is usually bad. [] Losing an indentity, Losing a heirloom, and Losing a relative are all deep and affective forms of loss. The question Solnit wants us to grapple with is when those things are no longer ontologically lost and you dealing with the aftermaths. Does something else replace it? Is the thing lost as being or lost as a piece of you? How will you transform in the wake of loss? []

An example that resonates with me on thinking of Loss as Thing are Buddhist practices and philosophy. They view the world through impermanence (Anicca) and non-attachment (Aparigraha) with the ultimate end goal is freeing themselves from wordly attacments. A material or even symbolic loss can be seen as neigh impossible in the state of enlightenment. A specific practice is the creation and destruction of sand mandalas. It is a ritual of letting go and fundamentally a reformation of identity under Buddhist thought. A transcendence of loss if you may.

I will the end the blog asking you to ponder a question I have myself. Doesn't losing a thing catlyze losing yourself? Losing an identity, seems very much attached to losing the self. But maybe that only applies when the thing lost constitutes the self. The negation of the question is just as important. 

What things can you lose without losing you?
