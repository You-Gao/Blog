# Analytical Reading List

After, stumbling my way through reasons and persons. Albeit I did try to read through it with a headache. I am making my list that I plan to finish by next semester of college for myself that covers logical thinking. Without further ado here is the smorgasbord of books I WILL read through:

* Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
* Language, Truth, and Logic
* Naming and Necessity
* On Sense and Reference
* On Denoting
* On What There is
* Theory of Syntax
