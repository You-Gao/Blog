# Analytical Reading List

[^1] [^2] [^3]

After, stumbling my way through reasons and persons. Albeit I did try to read through it with a headache. I am making my list that I plan to finish by next semester of college for myself that covers logical thinking. Without further ado here is the smorgasbord of books I WILL read through:

* Philosophical Investigations
* Language, Truth, and Logic
* Naming and Necessity
* On Sense and Reference
* On Denoting
* On What There is
* Theory of Syntax

2025-02-22: I FAILED terribly at this challenge.

[^1]: 8/22 (12:00 AM) - I tried to tackle Tractatus and On Sense and Reference, my head is spinning a bit.
[^2]: 8/22 (6:00 PM) - This is not fun at all.
[^3]: 9/20 - I'm not doing a good job at this.
