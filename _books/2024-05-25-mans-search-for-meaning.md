Everyone knows the quote but not the book where it came from. Frankl gives his account of living within concentration camps. He reflects on his encounters with those who lived or died and comparatively found a difference---"*hope.*" 

He posits that suffering is universal, but the ways in which people will cope with that truth and persevere is what makes humanity "*strong.*"

Frankl's logotherapy, then, is "*humanism,*" where its goal is to uplift human spirituality. Before Frankl, many thinkers echoed the same truths in their own philosophies. Nietzsche's "*will to power*," Bergson's "*vitality*," Husserl's "*Lebenswelt*," and Laozi's "*Tao*,". All of which asks us to recognize the power in being able to create our own "*meaning*."
