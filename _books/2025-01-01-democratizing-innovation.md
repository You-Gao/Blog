# Democratizing Innovation

> Users that innovate can develop exactly what they want, rather than relying on manufacturers to act as their (often very imperfect) agents.

The quote is the central thesis of the book. 



There was less discussion on non economic extrinsic motivators then I had wanted, but given the fact that the capital economy is how we coordinate social welfare, it would have be/been 100% academic suicide to tack on the point that open-source software could be marxist. Also a discussion on the institutional actors arguably doesn't need to inquire into that, again besides why they are even producing and transacting. I do like that aspect when discussing the more behavioral aspects institutional actors, the behavior of firms, or "business entities", but again, the motivations behind actions factors into behavior somewhere. Thanks for reading.
