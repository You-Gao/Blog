Picked up this book because I wanted to understand perception.[^1] In essence, what the quote means is the ways in which we see (view the world, receive visual stimuli) and what we know (the signs and signifiers imbued with meaning) are never stable nor comprehensive of the "*thing*" (person, object, other).

In short: "***people change, things change, words evolve, maps shift, or atleast impermanent in reference**"

Berger explains this effect by analyzing art, pictures, and their meanings. The subsequent concept of "*perspective phenomenology*" that he delivers is useful because it describes the whole point of phenomenology, at least for me, as the process of coming into understanding the nature of human "*inter-subjectivity.*"
