The book, seen as a ground-breaking work for other, is seen as a bit too schizophrenic for me. The problem being, Senge has a lot of ground to cover in too short of an amount of pages. As a reader, I can see the general goal, introduce the core concepts of "*systems-thinking*" then apply them to the multi-factored nature of different business domains. 

But the pedagogical lucidity is simply lost in the flood of anecdotes and context-switching between separate business domains. What I wished for more in this book was more conceptual clarify around what Senge means by "*systems-thinking*" before going on to apply its principles. Though, this may be because the field has advanced since then.

7/10, made me review topics I haven't thought of in a while. 

## Systems Thinking 

Gestalt thinking, systems thinking, arrows/loopy diagrams, complexity science, or "*big-picture*" thinking; Whatever you call it, the core tenets backing this methodology are these supposed facts:

1. The world is incomprehensibly complex.
2. Time is linear, but processes are non-linear.
3. Formal or "*purely*" mathematical logic can not express it.

Anyways, if you want to learn more, this lecture by the Santa Fe Institute is interesting.
