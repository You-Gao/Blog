# The Fifth Discipline

> "In the long run, the only sustainable source of competitive advantage is your organization's ability to learn faster than its competition."

The book, seen as a ground-breaking work for other, is seen as a bit too schizophrenic for me. The problem being, Senge has a lot of ground to cover in too short of an amount of pages. As a reader, I can see the general goal, introduce the core concepts of "systems-thinking" then apply them to the multi-factored nature of different business domains. 

But the pedagogical lucidity is simply lost in the flood of anecdotes and context-switching between separate business domains. What I wished for more in this book was more conceptual clarify around what Senge means by "systems-thinking" before going on to apply its principles. Though, this may be because the field has advanced since then, with many institutions now offering degrees in systems engineering and the Sante Fe Instittue touting their own discipline of complexity science.

7/10, made me review topics I haven't thought of in a while. 

## Systems Thinking 

Gestalt thinking, systems thinking, arrows/loopy diagrams, complexity science, or "big-picture" thinking; Whatever you call it, the core tenets backing this methodology are these supposed facts. The world is incomprehensibly complex; time is linear, but processes are non-linear, and loosely formal logic can not express these models of the world. Famous examples of this are widespread in pop science, like the butterfly effect or less known predator-prey dynamics in ecological systems.

Now that I'm thinking about it, chaos theory is another term for the same thing. However, in chaos theory, they are more thinking about dealing with a model error rather than expressing a model. They aren't too interested in formulating dynamical equations for non-linear systems but rather in the error due to different initial conditions. Taking a look at the butterfly effect, system-thinking approaches would be to model the system, i.e., the Lorenz system, and chaos theorists would obsess over why the model does not work.

Anyways, if you want to learn more, this lecture by the Santa Fe Institute is interesting.
