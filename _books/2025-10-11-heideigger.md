# 2 Heidegger Books on Language

> "pre-draft before reading"

One of my birthday presents was that I was allowed to pick out any books I wanted from a bookstore.

Given by current obsession over language I wanted to grab something form Wittgenstein, but he was nowhere to be found. So I had to settle with Heidegger. 

The only problem I have with Heidegger is that most translations have too much flourish; which might just be a failure of the English language. That isn't a problem cause I'm still interested to see what is in those books and what connections I can make between the two thinkers.

Maybe it is a bit perjorous to say, but from a 21st century standpoint, they were discussing topics we have a "*clearer*" understanding on[^1]. 

## What is "*thinking*"

> "Thinking is not having an opinion... not representing or having an idea of a state of affiars (early Wittegenstein)... not racio-nation logic (Piercian deductive/inductive/abductive... not simply critical thinking)"

The ability to distinguish between "*sense*" and "*nonsense*" has been a long-standing aim in philosophy. There have been discussions on a metaphysical level from "*realism*" to "*anti-realism*", on a logical level in the different kinds of "*formal logc*", on a epistemological level in the form of "*empiricism*" or "*positivism*" which circles back to metaphysical claims, and lastly rests upon the linuigistic layer[^2].

## Poetry, Language, Logic
