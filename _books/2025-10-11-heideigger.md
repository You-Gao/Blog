# 2 Heidegger Books on Language[^3]

> "pre-draft before reading"

One of my birthday presents was that I was allowed to pick out any books I wanted from a bookstore.

Given by current obsession over language I wanted to grab something form Wittgenstein, but he was nowhere to be found. So I had to settle with Heidegger. 

The only problem I have with Heidegger is that most translations have too much flourish; which might just be a failure of the English language. That isn't a problem cause I'm still interested to see what is in those books and what connections I can make between the two thinkers.

Maybe it is a bit perjorous to say, but from a 21st century standpoint, they were discussing topics we have a "*clearer*" understanding on[^1]. 

## What is "*thinking*"

> "Thinking is not having an opinion... not representing or having an idea of a state of affiars (early Wittegenstein)... not racio-nation logic (Piercian deductive/inductive/abductive... not simply critical thinking)"

The ability to distinguish between "*sense*" and "*nonsense*" has been a long-standing aim in philosophy. There have been discussions on a metaphysical level from "*realism*" to "*anti-realism*", on a logical level in the different kinds of "*formal logc*", on a epistemological level in the form of "*empiricism*" or "*positivism*" which circles back to metaphysical claims, and lastly rests upon the linuigistic layer[^2].

I have a slight suspicion it will circle back to saying the things he said aren't thinking were thinking after all.

## Poetry, Language, Thought 

> "the quote about things and ultimate things"

Things and ultimate things. Sometimes I feel concerned in the fact that I can lucidly arrive at what is being said or conveyed. What Heidegger says here kind of tracks Wittgensteins early "*picture theory*" approach and gets at his "*language games*" concept.

Ordinary things as in the quote like "*airplanes*" or "*radios*" generate a very material picture in our minds. Surely we know what an "*airplane*" is, if not by form; by function.

Ultimate things as in the quote like "*death*" or "*justice*" don't really have a "*strict definition*". I've written probably many blogs reflecting on how this is a problem in politics, social science, psychology, and data science, because ultimate things all need to be "*reified*" or "*defined*" in the observable world to have discourse.

But to say "*justice*" is "*one thing*" is different than describing a "*table*" as "*a thing*".

> "the quote about the painting being a symbol"

I thought about art interpretation and symbolism before in a [blog post], but it is until recently that I got a sufficient understanding of what "*interpretation*" and "*symbolism*" mean in a formal sense.

I think Heidegger is wrong here if we consider the chinese character language. Chinese is a "*logographic*" language.
