# The Art of Listening

Fromm has good ideas. I'm not a Fromm scholar in particular, but having read some of his previous works like "The Escape from Freedom" and "The Art of Loving"; it made me seek out some more of his works which ended up being the Art of Listening. The book itself is a collection of talks/seminars Fromm did later on in his career which arose from his own reflections on psychoanalysis and the insights he gathered from helping people psychologically.

What Fromm reflects upon deeply in the book as a psychoanalyst is the root cause of neurosis, or in modern terms mental illness. The key wisdom nugget from this that I appreciated the most is on the structural environmental causes of neurosis. Using the french term: Mal du si√®cle (sickness of the century), Fromm asks if we are all sick? He also goes on to ask if the structure and ways of being in modern society causes neurosis in everyone, Is the use of illness even valid? And these are good questions to ask because as we live our day to day without questioning the ways we relate to each other and the world; we further deepen our current modes as the only with no alternative. But as Fromm highlighted, such is the power of norms and no one is sick if everyone is sick.
