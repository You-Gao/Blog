# Et al.

Recently stumbled upon the works by a research engineer at GTRI (Georgia Tech Research Institute). I am glad I found and made this post to give the book a bit more of visibility. It's definitely not a one-read book and more of a table-stand free-time book. It contains a list of 30? "fictional science" articles that are written to satirelize scientific articles by using the same argumentative structures on an entirely absurd topic. What makes it good in my opinion, is how the article writers weave in technical concepts of their specific domain, where it puts the reader at an IYKYK situation in judging the factuality of the article. In reading it I've realized I need to dust-off some of my mathematical knowledge because I could not evaluate if the discussion on Cow-Based Planetoid supporting Methane Atmospheres fell into the realm of possible, kind-of feasible, or absurd. Because within that article it contained dicussions on escape velocity, maxwell-boltzmann distributions, and other conceptual ideas that I had no way of judging if it was conceptually accurate. It's like watching an XQCD What-If, but also not being able to trust that What-If is being put out in a scientifically accurate way.

I'll leave the foreward to the book because it basically sums up what you will further experience yourself:
