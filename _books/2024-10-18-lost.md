  A Field Guide to Getting Lost

## Pre-read

I want to speculate about the contents that I will encounter in the field guide to getting lost, because I have been in that state of being lost many times myself as well. So I think I know a thing or two.

I think the author will speak on being lost as positive more than negative. Being lost is not always a bad thing and can be employed in-fact very positively. Staying lost is a different story though.

Another point the author will write on is the epistemological nature of being loss, it necessitates a maximal amount of alertness, awareness, and openness with the space you are lost in. The radical openness allows you learn / gain information during those times of being lost as you feel your way around the space and its objects. 

It touches on the important of experience and "unknown unknowns". That some things really can't be known apriori and you have to allow yourself into the mode of being loss, if not you will never grow.

In essence it touches on not being afraid of the unknown. Being lost is just the potential for knowledge so don't fear it. At the start of the semester, we (students) in many ways are in the state of being lost.
