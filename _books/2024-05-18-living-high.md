# Living High and Letting Die

Two concepts, I mainly took away from Singer's work on critiquing moral intuitions and the way people have historically reasoned on ethics. One is social distance: the idea that how far removed a person geographically or mentally reduces the urgency / need in performing moral calculus. The second is something Singer argues for not only in ethical decisions, but also the broader social decisions as well, epistemic responsibilty. That we all have the duty to ensure that oneâ€™s beliefs, knowledge, and understanding are well-founded, justified, and based on reliable evidence.

What's missing for me here is the pracitcal application of the ethics set out in "Living High and Letting Die". How do you know the amount that you can contribute while still being left well-off? There is also the interesting reaction I have when reading the starting page which is the section on contributing $100 to UNICEF's program. The reaciton, atleast for me, is an immediate anxiety I have regarding my capital and the uses of such. I think it necessarilly hinges the destruction of my own trust in global institutions for actually converting that donation into any moral good. Given the amount of controversy that has gone around non-profits, I am skeptical.
