# Homo Ludens

I play and review games; I've done the play part more; *Homo Ludens* isn't about video games. I felt obligated to read the book as it "*felt*" related to my experiences with games.

The title of the book "*Homo Ludens*" translates to "*playing man*," similar to the more known "*Homo Economicus*." Huizinga shows how the concept of "*play*" is a precursor to society. It's interesting because that statement seemed like a reach until I remembered a lot of research in sociology and child development restates the importance of "*play.*"

If *Mind, Self, and Society* was about "*gestures*" and communication through symbols, *Homo Ludens* highlights the emphatic aspect of communication. Not only do we know what "*:)*" means, but also what that "*feels*" like. And you can't start a long-lasting civilization without empathy.
