It is a pretty dull and off-putting book to those with knowledge of introductory psychology, neuroscience, and sociology concepts. I would say it works as a motivational book more than anything. It had some excellent factoids from stuff in the literature, but it is interwoven with pseudo-scientific interpretations, which makes it more challenging to read through than adding any value. 

The only takeaway I had was a reminder to be aware about my environment and attitudes towards accomplishing something. If you are looking to get some deeper insights into productivity, I suggest Cal Newport's ["Deep Work"](https://blog.yougao.dev/work/deep-work/) over this book.

I get that the person is a trained nutritionist, so they wouldn't know much, but they should probably stick to that.
