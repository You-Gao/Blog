In *Mind, Self,and Society*, Mead provides some distinctions on social acts, the "*I*", the "*Me*", and expands on the notion of the "*other*". It no wonder on how important these concepts were to sociology. The notion that society as a whole negotiatites "*roles*", constructs "*norms*", and communicate that with "*symbols*" is spelled out in *Mind, Self, and Society*.
