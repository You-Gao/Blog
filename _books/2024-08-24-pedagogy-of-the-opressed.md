The book delivers a clear critique of how forms of instruction solidify the position of the oppressor against the oppressed. What Frerie does after delivering the critique is providing moves forward to *Conscientization* through the use of a dialogic and praxis. 

Maybe, I didn't fully understand the text (I did in-fact skim it), but aside from the productive discourse on oppressor and oppressed, a lot of the concepts developed further seemed to be a mix of historically detailed ideas. Which makes sense as he has been cited to been influenced by Fromm, Sartre, and Marcuse. Understanding it in in perspective makes the book a bit clearer, as the ethical and political implications end up radically indexed on humanism. 

Personally, the more relevant on those influences would be on Marcuse, specifically on Freire's conception of his critical pedagogy and how epistemological means fit in relation to Marcuse's work "One-Dimensional Man". Both highlighting the need for critical thinking against the historical and material realities as a way for the subject to experience "freedom".

This reflection can be skipped as my own ramblings. This book is my first "dive" into political theory and I think I have knowingly steered myself away from diving into such. Most of my past readings have been safely shielded in establishing a system of persons relating with each other. Looking at the philosophical branches I have covered: metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, phenomenology, logic, ethics, aesthetics. THE only one missing is politics and on how peoples should conduct themselves. I can appreciate the basic ideas from Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, but yeah, I don't know, maybe I'll get to the point where I feel comfortable on affirming my political positions aside from validating them to the arsenal of ethical theories. It's just that I have no clue at all of the full scopes/behavior of the objects underlying a political theory.
