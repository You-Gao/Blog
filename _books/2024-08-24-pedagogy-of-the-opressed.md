The book delivers a clear critique of how forms of instruction solidify the position of the opressor against the opressed. What Frerie does after delivering the critique is providing moves forward to *Conscientization* through the use of a dialogue and praxis. 

Maybe, I didn't fully understand the text, but aside from the productive discourse on opressor and opressed, a lot of the concepts developed further seemed to be a mix of historically detailed ideas. Which makes sense as he has been cited to been influenced by Fromm, Sartre, and Marcuse (These are the one's I have faithfully read, but there were more influences). Understanding it in in perspective makes the book a bit clearer, as the ethical and political implications end up radically indexed on humanism. 

** Note: The true problem I find isn't with humanism, but the seeming inability to practice it as a neoliberal subject.

Personally, the more relevant on those influences would be on Marcuse, specifically on Freire's conception of his critical pedagogy and how epistemological means fit in relation to Marcuse's work "One-Dimensional Man". Both highlighting the need for critical thinking against the historical and material realities as a way for the subject to experience "freedom".

** Note: I think I'm still left a bit pessimistic, but I do have hope. 

This reflection can be skipped as my own ramblings. This book is my first "dive" into political theory and I think I have knowingly steered myself away from diving into such. Most of my past readings have been safely shielded in establishing a system of persons to interact with each other. Looking at the philosophical branches I have covered: metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, phenomenology, logic, ethics, aesthetics. THE only one missing is politics and on how peoples should conduct themselves. I can appreciate the basic ideas from Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, but yeah, I don't know, maybe I'll get to the point where I feel comfortable on affirming my politicla positions aside from validating them to the arsenal of ethical theories.
