# The Trouble With Being Born

I think a better title for the book would be a *The Trouble With Being*. I read this book after reading it along-side "*The Unbearable Lightness of Being*" because I thought it would be funny to have read two books with clearly opposite framings on "*being*".

I say this book is better titled "*The Trouble With Being*" because Cioran doesn't have a problem with birth, but existence. The question of "*Being*", of existing with the self, and others questions of the same sense has been a constant throughout the human canon. Buddhism's "*illusory self*", "*existentialism*" or "*the absurd*", "*metaphysics*" in some ways, *Heidegger*'s entire project, and even shows up in famous literature.
