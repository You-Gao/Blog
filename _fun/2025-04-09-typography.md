# typography is fun[^1]

I recently went down the rabbit hole that is typography, specifically the formal elements of typography and how that affects the meaning. Questions like why does Nerd font look so "*nerdy*" or why does Comic Sans look so "*goofy.*" I won't answer that in this post directly, but I wanted to give context to my guiding questions down this rabbit hole[^2]. Like how there is a "*language*" to data visualization in relation to quantity, I wondered if there was a "*language*" in typography in relation to textual content[^3].

In doing so, I made some delightful discoveries. The reason why Nerd fonts have been deemed "*nerdy*" is because they are monospace sans-serif typefaces. Monospace typefaces have been historically used in coding applications because they allow clear spacing between letters, which heavily affects the readability of a codebase. Thus, the usage of monospace fonts, even as far as having people make a monospace typeface called "*Nerd,*" follows from the historical usage due to its function. The same can be said of serif's reputation for "*elegance*" or sans-serif's reputation for "*modern.*"

## my personal favorite fonts

I didn't make this post to share the history and progression of typography[^4]. I made this post to share my favorite fonts that I went and found after reading. In no particular order, here they are grouped by typeface family.

### sans-serif

* Bauhaus: It was created with formalism as its key point, using only "*bars*" and "*circles.*"
* Noto Sans: I like this font for its ethos (no tofu), a typeface that spans all languages.
* Helvetica: A "*neutral*" typeface.

### monospace

* Nerd Family: It's a good font.
* Inconsolata: Default for VSCode.
* Terminess: A specific nerd font I use.

### serif[^5]

* Spectral: The "*e*" glyph makes it feel "*floaty.*"

### script

I don't know of any script typefaces that I like.

[^2]: (I will answer it in the footnotes) In my deep-dive, I found that we only confer those fonts' meaning "after the fact." It's not because there are formal elements to Nerd font that make it "*nerdy*" but rather because Nerd font is fit for the task of representing code that it **is** "*nerdy.*"
[^3]: (I will also answer this) The answer here is yes, there is a "*language*" or a "*formal*" way to represent content. The important part here that I didn't pick up on is that the form really follows function. Just as math represents the concept of numbers, the same holds true about typography."
[^4]: Interestingly enough, though, it follows much of the parallels of "*time-frames*" that were found in literature and art.
[^5]: Serifs are overrated, IMO. They don't even help with legibility, so print legibility. I use a screen most of the time, so I might be biased.
