# mspaint

I love mspaint. Microsoft has not made a better app for the Windows ecosystem than mspaint. One could argue that the Task Manager or Note Pad is 2nd, but it is not even close to the greatness that is mspaint. The quick load time and expressive capability of mspaint cements it in the Windows hall of fame.

## runner-ups

I felt it would be redundant just to write a blog praising mspaint, so here are some other useful apps that I use apart of Microsoft or not!

### microsoft
* notepad: simple, again fast, and all stored to a single folder (atleast for me).
* snip & sketch: always had to use gyazo for this, but now they have a "*native*" solution.

### not-microsoft
* windirstat: very useful when cleaning up files to make space.
