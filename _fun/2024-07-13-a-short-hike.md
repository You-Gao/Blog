# A Short Hike

<img src="{{ 'assets/games/a-short-hike/game_logo.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Logo" class="game_logo"/>


## Introduction
The game begins with the main character---a bird---traveling in a car with Aunt May---also a bird---to a hiking location. This sets the stage for the adventure and exploration that follows.

## Player Mechanics
- **Character Control:** ```WASD``` to move around.
- **Jumping and Gliding:** ```Z``` to jump. ```Hold Z``` to glide. 
- **Item Usage:** ```X``` to use item.
- **Running:** ```C``` to run (requires running shoes)

**Complexity in Simplicity:** The mechanics are simple, yet mastering them provides a sense of challenge and fulfillment. The gliding mechanic, in particular, offers depth, encouraging players to learn and refine their control.

## Game Mechanics

**Golden Feathers:** Golden feathers enhance the character's abilities, allowing for additional jumps or extended climbing. The feathers are literally and metaphorically a form of "*growth*". Collecting them allows you to progress and unlock more areas until you reach the top.

**Mountain Top:** The game's main objective is to reach the peak of a tall mountain---initially inaccessible to the player. The goal of getting to the top sets a clear, but ephemeral measurement of the player's progress.

**Mountain Top (Frozen):** At a specific altitude of the mountain, the golden feathers are frozen upon use and are only replenished when the player gets to a warm zone. The mechanic is essentially a skill check for the player, serving as a way to test how well they understand the player mechanics.

**NPCs**: NPCs provide the player with tasks that offer both growth and narrative depth. While the quests themselves grant golden feathers and encourage exploration; NPCs add a layer of storytelling and character development. 

**Quests:** Each of the quests focuses on a unique aspect of the game while granting the player more feathers. The existence of these quests incentivizes the player to actively search for NPCs.

## Design Choices

**Perspective and Camera Work:** A unique aspect of *A Short Hike* is primarily the camerawork around the mountain. It does not follow the conventional 3D perspective used in shooters where the camera is above and behind the player, but instead focuses on the mountain as if it were looking towards the center.

**Art Style and Atmosphere:** *A Short Hike* has a charming pixel art style and vibrant color palette. The game's visuals evoke a sense of nostalgia and simplicity, contributing to a warm and inviting atmosphere. This artistic choice, combined with the tranquil and picturesque environment makes the game feel relaxing and encourages further exploration into the world.

**Soundtrack:** Each track is crafted to match different areas and moments within the game, creating an auditory journey that aligns with the player's progress. The soundtrack not only enriches the atmosphere but also adds emotional depth.

**No Fall Damage:** One of the refreshing gameplay mechanics in *A Short Hike* is the absence of fall damage. This design choice allows players to explore the mountain freely without the fear of negative consequences from falling.

## Themes and Player Experience

**Growth and Mastery:** A big theme in *A Short Hike* is growth---which goes hand-in-hand with mastery. You start off with a single golden feather, which slowly increases until you get the max of twenty. Along the way, "*you*" and the "*character*" both grow. On the one hand, via learning the game mechanics better, and on the other by simply having more feathers. 

**Exploration and Discovery:** As players collect golden feathers, they experience increased freedom, reinforcing themes of exploration and discovery. The mountain serves as both a metaphorical and literal goalpost, marking player progression. There's a point where you can unlock a special feather that increases your capabilities two-fold.

**Non-competitive Challenge:** The mountain presents a challenge without adversaries, focusing on personal achievement and the joy of overcoming obstacles rather than on competition.

**Narrative and Connection:** The game's narrative acts as the cohesive glue that binds together its diverse aesthetics, advancing the storyline and immersing players in its world. 

## Conclusion and Reflection

*A Short Hike* effectively blends simple mechanics with deep, meaningful themes. The journey up the mountain is a testament to the player's growth, mirroring real-life experiences of learning, exploration, and the satisfaction of achieving personal goals. Through its design, the game creates a fulfilling and introspective experience for the player.

My own reflections on the game led me to the conclusion that I should go on a hike sometimes. Having thought about what a hike means to me, I realized that the only reason I don't go on hikes was because of my previous conceptions of them. I always thought of them like stick-to-the-path adventures and the reward was the view.

Not to discount that, but I wouldn't see myself hiking for that reason. Hiking for physical growth is another reason, but if that's the only thing, it's more efficient to hit the treadmill.

With that said, the motivator missing for me is the people climbing along with me. In the actual world, a hiker wouldn't normally encounter a shady person dealing enhancements or in search of 15 seashells (hiking with micro-missions). I've also heard from others that a hike might include going off the path and then getting lost to eventually find yourself at the scenic view. 

This is all to say that everything I have written about the themes and aesthetics in *A Short Hike* equally applies to actually hiking, so go touch some grass.

Here is a clip of the most memorable moment for me in *A Short Hike*.
