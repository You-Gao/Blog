# Perfect Days

If I **had** to choose my favorite movie, it would be Perfect Days.

The film shares a truth I similarly hold about living and a very buddhist truth in a way. A truth that says being content is a mental state worth magnitudes above happiness. To accept, eh moreso understand, the phrase "*this is life*" and being "*at peace*" with the world.

## Hirayama

Wim Wenders uses Hirayama to demonstrate this truth. Hirayama is a japanese toilet cleaner who follows a mundane daily/weekly routine and also doesn't go out as much. Wenders notably plays with the fact that we "*viewers*" are in a way acting as judges for Hirayama.

"Hirayama is a janitor, he is a failed man."

"These rituals are only a way for Hirayama to cope with his sad life."

It speaks a lot to how we use people's jobs as saying something of a person's internal psyche. Anyone who works X job is "*clearly miserable*" or "*lazy*" or "*boring*" or "*unsatisfied*" or Y negative trait. 

This is exactly how Hirayama's sister interprets Hirayama. She sees that Hirayama is a janitor and tells him the same in the later parts of the film. So how is Hirayama happy despite all of this?

## "Other Minds" & "I"

I wager that Hirayama is happy simply because he has accepted others will interpret him as such and simply moves on with his life. He doesnâ€™t fight their perceptions, nor does he internalize them. He lives.

This speaks too key concept and a question in cognitive science, and somewhat in sociology as well; the concept of "*self*" or "*I*". A famous question that plays off that is the "*problem of other minds*". It asks the question of how you could **definitively know** a person's internal mental state without needing to make the leap of assumption or inference. It's something we are all probably well aware of given how much "*first impressions*" or "*reading intent*" is valued.

The point is that Hirayama has access to his "*I*", he knows and has access to his own cognition. He knows himself if he truly is miserably or in abject sorrow throughout his day-to-day and doesn't rely on societal perceptions in establishing his "*self*". He accepts that others will misunderstand him. And rather than correct them, he continues living as he always has.
