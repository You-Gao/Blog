# Perfect Days

If I **had** to choose my favorite movie, it would be *Perfect Days*.

The film shares a truth I similarly hold about living and a very Buddhist truth. A truth that says being content is a mental state worth magnitudes above happiness. To accept, more so, understand the phrase "*this is life*" and being "*at peace*" with the world.

## Hirayama

Wim Wenders uses Hirayama to demonstrate this truth. Hirayama is a Japanese toilet cleaner who follows a mundane daily/weekly routine and doesn't go out as much. Wenders notably plays with the fact that we "*viewers*" are, in a way, acting as judges for Hirayama.

> "Hirayama is a janitor; he is a failed man."

> "These rituals are only a way for Hirayama to cope with his sad life."

It speaks a lot to how we use people's jobs to infer something of a person's internal psyche. Anyone who works X job is "*clearly miserable*" or "*lazy*" or "*boring*" or "*unsatisfied*" or Y negative trait. 

This is exactly how Hirayama's sister interprets Hirayama. She sees that Hirayama is a janitor and demeans him in the later parts of the film. So how is Hirayama happy despite all of this?

## "Other Minds" & "I"

I wager that Hirayama is happy simply because he has accepted others will interpret him as such and simply moves on with his life. He doesnâ€™t fight their perceptions, nor does he internalize them. He lives[^2]. 

This speaks to a key concept and a question in cognitive science, and somewhat in sociology as well; the concept of "*self*" or "*I.*" A famous question that relates to this is the "*problem of other minds.*" It asks the question of how you could **definitively know** a person's internal mental state without needing to make the leap of assumption or inference. It's something we are all probably well aware of given how much "*first impressions*" or "*reading intent*" is valued.

The point is that Hirayama has access to his "*I*"; he knows and has access to his own cognition. He knows himself if he truly is miserably or in abject sorrow throughout his day-to-day and doesn't rely on societal perceptions in establishing his "*self*." He accepts that others will misunderstand him. And rather than correct them, he continues living as he always has.

## Miscellaneous

* The [website](https://www.perfectdays-movie.jp/) for the movie inspired me to learn more about design.
* The [architecture](https://tokyotoilet.jp/en/) of the bathrooms shown throughout the film was simply stunning as well.
* The [soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5De282WtacLuUReEXqwuET) of the film are all old classics that feel very human.

[^1]: The metaphor helps in understanding what I'm trying to say; speaking of the self always ends up sounding loosey-goosey.
[^2]: Hirayama doesn't speak much; we only view his actions, which makes me a bit surer in what Wenders was trying to illustrate.
