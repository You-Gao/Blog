# h1 - Game Name

### [ PICTURE ]

## h2 - Introduction

A classic of the TBS (turn based strategy genres) where you take on the job of a historic ruler to conquer the world. The goal is to become the dominant power on the planet, through a mix of exploration, diplomacy, military conquest, and technological advancement. In the path to victory, you will have to manage resource allocation, building cities, and wage war against Nuclear Gandhi. It really is a rich and diverse TBS that tries to capture all the aspects of a progression of civilization.

## h2 - Player Mechanics

- **Unit Movement** - Click and move units to perform actions, battle, etc.
- **Resource Allocation** -  Select the specific resources to "work"
- **Decision-making** - It was kind of awkward thinking of specifically player mechanics because for Turn-based Games you are just interacting w/ the main game mechanics. There isn't a single "body" to control, rather a system.

## h2 - Game Mechanics

- **Government Policies** - Specific unlocks and civilizations in the game give governor tiles which can be used to recruit a Governor to your city. Dynamically effects the game state due to how it sets or enhances the game-plan of a civilization.
- **Civic and Tech Trees** - Allows players to "invest" turns into unlocking specific technologies on the tree. Each of these technologies and civics are very dependent to the type of nation, civilization ruler, and such forth. This adds yet another layer of dynamism in deciding what is the best path for the game-plan.
- **Eureka** - Boost's the tech tree when the player has met certain requirements like make 6 farms or kill a barbarian. This is more of a micro dynamism that does heavily coincide with the larger game-plan.
- **Resources** (Faith, Gold, Culture, Science) - Counters that can be seen as being "incremented" and can be spent to further the game state. Gold is especially important in the early game as it can be used to always maximize the feedback loop of growth for the cities. All of these resources end-up as a way to win the game: science, war (gold), culture, religion, which all leads to score.
- **City-states** - Separate cities around the map that grant player's nation some benefits when you complete their nations or send envoys. Also, dynamically impacts the game-state as some of the bonuses can cause drastic growth via boosts to production or gold production.
- **Battle** - Units can attack other units or cities. Necessary for WAR. Oh and there are this whole set of terrain bonuses, military buffs, ranged/melee units, and a lot of intricacies/idiosyncrasies.
- **Great People** - Units that can be recruited with "Great People Points" that are awarded through all of the different things above. Again, adds a dynamism because these units are usually so strong that you should go for them even if they are unoptimal in the short-term.
- **Districts** - Buildings that grant specific bonuses and have bonuses based on the tiles around it. One of the more confusing portions of the game-plan... or at least I have not figured it out because you need to eventually build all of them to meet specific pieces of the plan. In other words, you can't just build one for your win condition and expect it to work.
- **Wonders** - Buildings that grant very strong and specific bonuses but costs a lot of turns to produce. There also can only be one being built and if it does you basically wasted all your turns doing so, which results in this being high risk high reward. Another point is, you should usually just focus on growing before you begin production
- **Amenities** - Luxury resources that require builders to spend a charge to harvest. These provide a +1 amenities which can increase the happiness of a city which thus increases the overall resource production of the city. Amenities scale throughout the game by requiring more amenities the higher your population grows.

## h2 - Themes and Player Experience

- **Achievement** - I put achievement instead of winning because in Civ, the real joy is seeing how you get from 1 settler and 1 warrior to this super advanced death-bot producing nation. It isn't just seeing the victory screen, because if that were the case I wouldn't have been playing Civ at all (Do people actually always play through to the end). An example I have is from CPL (Civilizations Player League) is that most of the multiplayer ranked matches don't actually end in a win screen for a specific player. Instead it is played until they get to a game state where everyone is satisfied with and then the score gets tallied.
- **Competition -** The warmongerer path of beating everyone around you on all of the metrics. I put this under achievement because, competition is the more negativeness framing of interaction in Civ, but really most FFA multiplayer lobbies are going for achievement. You can play the game in a "have to beat everyone mindset" and it is incentive. However, the "stronger" way of playing an actually achieving competition is seeing how you can mutually benefit others through trade and geopolitical agreements.
- **Immersion** - If you want to experience what it was like for Teddy Roosevelt to build America starting from the ancient times, then look no further because you can do that here in Civ. Besides the ability to play leaders, the game itself has many options to achieve "realism" like environmental effects and the different historically accurate routes to victory like nuking the world as Gandhi.
- **Social Interaction** - There are those that enjoy queuing up a Civ game by themselves against AI and playing it through. I am not one of them. Whenever I do play Civ it is usually in a lobby with other people or catching up with my friends on Discord. Given that case I don't necessarily play to win, but play for whichever win-condition that I think will be the most fun for everyone. That win-condition is basically playing towards what my ruler is designed towards and hard committing, which also makes it easier to talk while doing so.

## h2 - Conclusion

Turnbased Games are complex. Before my first couple of games and tutorials I was not thinking about how to pump out settlers in hand with the civilization tech with 50% settler production. But alas, I am now correctly scouting for the city state and doing the trade-off calculation for my culture tempo in relation to my game-plan. I am even placing down the markers to plan where my districts should be placed so they have the maximum local tile bonuses. It is a dark dark path to enjoying the game.

Besides the game itself, it actually made me reflect a lot on the nature of development. One of my majors besides Computer Science is Global Development Studies which talks mainly about the economic and political systems set-up to deliver wealth to Nations. Civ follows the traditional modernization theories where increases in technology and increases in industrialization is necessary for a nation to take off. Trade and dependencies on other nation's are good as well because it is mutually beneficial to everyone. In a way it is like a liberalist utopia because there really is no down-side to any of these upgrades besides the time put into developing nations. Alas in the real world, there are major side-effects to technological and industrial development which are distributed unequally. Even considering the utopia, there is something very anti liberalist which is that you decide *cough* / plan the economy by deciding what tiles are worked. The only thing they would complain about is not having enough amenities based on population size.

Good game, should play 10/10.
