# **Guilty Gear Strive Game Analysis**

<img src="{{ 'assets/games/ggst/header.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Logo" class="game_logo"/>

### *Introduction:*

Guilty Gear Strive is a pretty popular game with a lot of purchases on Steam for being $50. It's a classic fighting game genre made by Daisuke Ishiwatari and is often praised for what it offers to the fighting game community. Although, it does get a lot of flack for being "scrubby", but I think it makes the game accessible. There is a high skill ceiling, but also a low skill floor. The quick match system in the game also makes skill-based matchmaking bearable. I personally have 300+ hours on it, all on one character, so here is my reflection after playing that much.

### *Player Mechanics*

- **Moves:** Attack inputs are punch, kick, slash, heavy slash, and duster.

- **Specials:** Inputs can be stringed together with movement keys to execute special moves.

- **Supers:** Super special moves that require meter to use.

- **Duster:** A high-risk input that launches the opponent for an air combo.

- **RC (Roman Cancel):** 0 clue, why it was stands for roman cancel, but it allows you to use meter to cancel a move, extend a combo, or slow the game down.

- **Burst Cancel:** A "get off me" button that resets the game state to neutral.

### *Game Mechanics*

- **Matches -** Every match is a first to 2, where you need to reduce the life bar of the opponent to 0 twice to win. The only interesting portion on how this is set-up and impacts a round is that the burst gauge carriers over between rounds, so if you used the burst, it might still be on cooldown the next round. For me, it functions as a reminder to be wary about my resources that I have and how I should utilize them to win not only the round, but the match as well.

- **Meter** **-** Each attack and move adds to the bar throughout the fight. It allows the player to execute supers and roman cancels which can be used different ways to extend combos, deal more damage, mix-ups, and more. The meter bar in a way incentivizes interaction and is carefully used to balance the ways a player can gain an advantage or reset to neutral.

- **Wall Breaks -** Although not directly unique to Guilty Gear, the wall break mechanic adds a new layer of interaction to getting the opponent in a corner. The only other popular fighting game that has this is Tekken? It just adds something fresh to the traditional game-plan's of getting the opponent into the corner and performing mix-ups. Instead, the goal is to break to wall for extra dmg in a combo and gain meter bonus.

- **Characters -** The cast of the game boasts a pretty diverse and wide set of characters. In the fighting game genre, these character archetypes have been sort of "solved" in a sense for the game plan of the character: grappler, zoner, shoto, pixie, etc. But, it is also important to recognize how it's not directly linear in a game plan and depending on match-ups that would change. On-top of this archetypal difference, each character has a unique set of tools, combo routes, and interactions that when managed efficiently gives rise to a pretty deep expression of the player.

### *Themes and Player Experience*

- **Social Interaction:** The reason why I play Guilty Gear Strive really is the social aspect of it. Going against another "real" player (until ai gets too advanced) makes me actually take the game seriously. Serious insofar as. we both sort of take on these agencies of the characters and openly play. It’s not just about winning or losing; it’s about the encounter itself, the back-and-forth of skill, mind games, and adaptation.

- **Narrative:** Building on that point. For people that you go against online, especially after you hit Celestial floor, because you don't know specifically who the person you are against; there is this historical narrative of the other player. Over-time you create stories of triumph, defeat, growth, as such because playstyles evolve even in the span of a match.

- **Competition:** In the end though, there is that Suitsian aspect of the game where each match there has to be a winner. Unconsciously and even consciously there is that joy of winning, I just think when the unconscious resolves of winning takes over (* the more neurophysiological and psychological aspects), then the competition has been sort of perverted.

- **Expression:** Each character lends itself to have skill and character expression. What is your playstyle, how does that playstyle change, how do you adapt, and etc. produces the dimension of expression through not only skill, but also personality.  


I get how people might be confused on me putting social interaction and narrative here. The idea is there are two ways people can go about playing games. The individualistic subject that plays to win or the community subject that plays to connect. After reflecting on games, I feel like they have so much more power as a connective medium than the former relation. While the thrill of competition is undeniable, the moments where I’ve bonded with others—whether through friendly banter, exchanging tips, or even just mutual respect after a hard-fought match.

### *Conclusion*

With all that being said, Guilty Gear is a game that is fun for me and I recognize when it is not fun either. It's not fun when I am not playing for play purposes, but instead I am playing to win. Should you play Guilty Gear? Yes, if you have nothing better to do. It's a pretty great leisure time activity and better than a lot of other alternatives that take up a lot of time. A match is pretty quick like 5 minutes max to complete one.

On another point, Guilty Gear made me reflect on the point of playing games. Often, it can lend itself to this individualistic point of winning above all else; this is a very banal way of understanding games in my opinion. Fighting games are very different from the conception of winning in relation to something like chess. It provides a layer to the turn-based interaction and provides a stronger argument to the social nature of games. As chess have been solved via game theory and algorithms, fighting games to an extent haven't. The explanation to that is essentially the social aspect and complexities of this multivariable-multidimensional social calculus happening in the back drop of a game.
