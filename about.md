## [!WARNING!] monologue alert [!WARNING!]

my wife left me, took the kids. lost of all my money. dark and stormy night. tore my acl. betrayed by close friends. diagnosed with a terminal illness. and got cancelled on twitter (X)... 

alright, putting the dramatic explicates aside, the actual reason why i started this blog was to have a place for formal dialogue with who i am. practice my hand at creation and learn more about myself in the process ya know. the feature topics were chosen because i felt like they were tangible pieces of identity for me and so i could further formalize the existing thoughts i had for them.

what you will encounter in the blog are the perspectives and takes i have synthesized on those topics. and if i turn out to be a decent blogger, there is something tangible and unique to skedaddle out with as a takeaway. 

enjoy the site, no matter how you have stumbled onto this crevice of the internet.
