# My Productivity Set-up

This is my set-up for school-work and other serious life goals that I want to seriously achieve.

## The Thinkpad

The main driver of the show is this laptop that I found off Goodwill for $65 + $10 shipping. I already had a laptop, but mainly wanted to find one for school because from experience my MSI laptop with an RTX inside of it was not cutting it by any margins on the portability front. That is why on a fateful summer day I decided I needed to find a slim < 13 inch laptop that could handle my needs as a CS student. It was only after I received that I realiezd what a god-send it was because the sound didn't work (probably just Manjaro ngl...) and the already pre-planned low specs of the device that could keep me off, even unwillingly, the internet. 

The Specs:
* OS: Manjaro Linux x86_64
* Host: 20AMS0EV00 ThinkPad X240 
* Resolution: 1366x768
* WM: i3
* Terminal: urxvt
* CPU: Intel i5-4300U (4) @ 2.900GHz
* GPU: Intel Haswell-ULT 
* Memory: 1237MiB / 7636MiB
* Storage: 500 GB

Looking back, this was seriously underpriced and I'm glad I bought it. Besides the story it has sent me down the road as a user of nvim and linux which I will report back in a while on how it is going.

## Terminal and Tiling Manager

The first actual modification I made to my environment was spending a couple hours editing my terminal configs to give it a good feel everytime I loaded it up. There's no point in productivity other than the creative aspect of making sure its a unique and separate mental mode. I also made sure to download a folder of fun / aesthetic images to randomize each boot with; very important that they match the theme you configured as well. Another very important thing to do is to go in and cusotmize your .bashrc to print something fun like a quote or ascii image out everytime it opens.

Another key thing for my environment besides the terminal is the tiling manager. It allows me to consciously context switch between tasks, which helps me dial in on the tasks/purpose I gave a specific window. This practice does seem restricive at first, but the productivity gain from it in constrast to alt-tabbing on Windows is greatly appreciated.

The 5 named windows I have are:
1. Google
2. PDF
3. Joplin
4. Terminal
5. Habitica/To-Do

## Joplin

A pretty solid open-source note taking app. I know Obsidian exists, but I already have a system going on for me and the trade-off isn't there for me to switch over. I have largely 3 groups of tag that I utilize and browse through which are based on their purpose. Each tag essentially lets you view the notes or sub-notebooks attaches wihch are usually just textbook readings etc. I'll list them below for you to judge if they are effective. Overall though, Jopling solid .md note taker, minimal and effective.

* .compsci and .human (my two majors)
* /basher, /designer /jupyter, /vimer, /vscoder (prospective career paths)
* #life, #phil, $facts, $work (general categories for life)

## Habitica

This app is one of the more interesting ones of the list. The app aims to gamify daily tasks, habits, and to-do lists in a positive way. And it does largely achieve that atleast for me. The thing with any habit tracker/daily task app; for it to be effective you need to do critical inquiry about what are you goals in life and then go in to set them up in the app. In a sense you are developing your "virtual self" that mirrors what you want to be in reality. It's a continuous process to reflect and see what other things you would like to artificially incentivize. On that point as well, you can create separate accounts for school, work, or however you want to segment it. 

## To-do

The classic to-do list everyone has. I use Microsoft because it syncs flagged emails and to Outlook's calendar so it is integrated. I don't use it too often for daily tasks then I would like, just because I'm not the greatest at estimating out what to do for the day. It is mostly used to store book-lists of what I plan on reading next, things I need to review, and serves as a general backlog for categories.

(I skipped PDF, but it's some generic one that I always have to check htop for)
