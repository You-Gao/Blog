# My Productivity Set-up

This is my set-up for school-work and other serious life goals that I want to seriously achieve.

## The Thinkpad

The main driver of the show is this laptop that I found off Goodwill for $65 + $10 shipping. I already had a laptop, but mainly wanted to find one for school because from experience my MSI laptop with an RTX inside of it was not cutting it by any margins on the portability front. That is why on a fateful summer day I decided I needed to find a slim < 13 inch laptop that could handle my needs as a CS student. It was only after I received that I realiezd what a god-send it was because the sound didn't work (probably just Manjaro ngl...) and the already pre-planned low specs of the device that could keep me off, even unwillingly, the internet. 

The Specs:
* OS: Manjaro Linux x86_64
* Host: 20AMS0EV00 ThinkPad X240 
* Resolution: 1366x768
* WM: i3
* Terminal: urxvt
* CPU: Intel i5-4300U (4) @ 2.900GHz
* GPU: Intel Haswell-ULT 
* Memory: 1237MiB / 7636MiB
* Storage: 500 GB

Looking back, this was seriously underpriced and I'm glad I bought it. Besides the story it has sent me down the road as a user of nvim and linux which I will report back in a while on how it is going.

## Terminal and Tiling Manager

The first actual modification I made to my environment was spending a couple hours editing my .bashrc to give it a good feel everytime I loaded it up. There's no point in productivity other than the creative aspect of making sure its a unique and separate mental mode. I also made sure to download a folder of fun / aesthetic images to randomize each boot with; very important that they match the theme you configured as well. Anyways heres the end results of .bashrc faningaling: Banner that tells me weather, class, and time. A quote to ponder on for 1 second. A large ASCII drawing that I spent too long customizing.
