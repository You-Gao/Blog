# Life and Living

## Childhood Me

I made this to reflect on what I do when I'm not deeply working. In my childhood the main thing I did when I went home was to play games or scroll through social media. Talking to friends was a major part of gaming though. Nowadays, I don't really play games to that fervor anymore as I have found myself valuing interacting with the environment around me more; The previous behavior was definitely fueled by an escapism that was co-opted.

## Living

If work is to set a goal as the means to an end (still can serve a larger goals), than I see living life as an end in itself (still can be goal oriented). For me work is a matter of duty to society and humanity whereas life is simply existing for my values. And reflecting on my values made me think back to an experience I had for a side-project w/ a CS Professor who was really into value-based living. There was some wisdom in that and I still have my notes from the retreat, but the main thing I took away was realize my 3 key values were learning, growth, and openness.

*Note: Looking at this, I realize there is an aspect of life in job as well. I could not be a bureaucrat.

So how does that lead me to organize my daily activities towards those values?

## Things I Do Day-to-Day

1. Read Books: Finding resources and reading up on interesting topics that come up
2. Notes/Blogs: These acts as sort of a scoreboard for learning and growth but also fun to make
3. Games: Largely is a social function still nowadays, but also fun in trying to get better at them
4. Movies: Helps me does a lot of self-reflection and relation to characters, but also in for the story
5. Exercise: Physical upkeep and helps grant some dopamine as well
6. Reflection: Taking like 5-10 minutes laying down and hashing out my thoughts on the day
7. Social Media: I limited it to an hour, but largely serves as a function for news

I think sometimes though, it is about just getting to the next day. BUT be intentional when you can.

There's no need to subscribe yourself to an -ism (although Zizek disagrees), but there is historic function.

I support radical responsibility, critical thinking, and civic duty. (Reminder to not write at midnight)
