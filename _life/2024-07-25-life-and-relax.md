# Life and Living

## Childhood Me

I made this reflection on what I do when I'm not working deeply. In my childhood, the main thing I did when I went home was play games or scroll through social media. Talking to friends was a major part of gaming, though. Nowadays, I don't really play games with that fervor anymore as I have found myself valuing interacting with the environment around me more. The previous behavior was definitely fueled by a co-opted escapism.

## Living

Suppose work is the means to an end (still can serve a larger goal), then I see living life as an end in itself (still can be goal-oriented). For me, work is a matter of duty to society and humanity, whereas living exists for my values. And reflecting on my values made me think back to an experience I had for a side-project w/ a CS Professor who was really into value-based living. There was some wisdom in that, and I still have my notes from the retreat, but the main thing I took away was to realize my three key values were learning, growth, and openness. [^1] 

How does that lead me to organize my daily activities to fit those values?

## Things I Do Day-to-Day

1. Read Books: Finding resources and reading up on interesting topics that come up
2. Notes/Blogs: These act as sort of a scoreboard for learning and growth
3. Games: Chat with the friends over Minecraft
4. Movies: Cinema, cinema is just great, I love it
5. Exercise: Physical upkeep and helps grant some dopamine as well
6. Reflection: Take 5-10 minutes lying down and hashing out my thoughts on the day
7. Social Media: I limited it to an hour, helps keep me in the loop

Sometimes, though, it is just about getting to the next day. BUT be intentional when you can.
