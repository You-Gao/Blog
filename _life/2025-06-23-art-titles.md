# Why Do Artworks Need Titles?

Do all artwork have titles? What is the point to them? Does it add anything to the painting? I think the answer is yes and no.

A hallmark of the perjorative "*modern art*" is a sense of obscurantism; where the more metaphorical your work the better---though it devolves to meaninglessness. Having a title in this situation is helpful, in so far as having the artist themself explain the work. For all I care, paint a rock and title the piece "*me*"; Having the title there is at least something to work off of.

On the other hand, I feel like there are artists that can paint the "*ineffable.*" There isn't a need to title a painting of a Tree "*Tree 06.23*", unless the work is within a collection where the context does indeed add meaning. The distinction here being [iconic vs. symbolic](https://thisvsthat.io/iconic-signs-vs-symbolic-signs).

"*Realist*" paintings can be thought of as "*iconic*" as they aim to mimic our perception of the world. It's not hard to make out what the drawing is. On the other hand, "*modern art*" works on the "*symbolic*" level. The painting is not of perception but representation. That's probably when I would want a title.

After all, ["***the map is not the territory***"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation) and "***Ceci n'est pas une pipe***"
