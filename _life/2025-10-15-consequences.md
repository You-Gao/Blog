# facing our consequences

It is a cruel trick of time and life that it is often or not impossible to experience the consequences of our actions the moment we do them. The common phrase of "*I wouldn't have done that if I knew what would've happened*" is a tragedy that has repeated itself across the universe. The current state of the world does not escape this.

Climate change, blooming debt, low reproduction rates, market bubbles, unbounded gluttony, unchecked greed, cancerous fertilizer, digital addiction, pollution, deforestation, and the majority of human activity run aface with the same folly. The ability to wholesale exchange the future for a more "*enjoyable*" now is all too human[^1][^2]. So the question is "*how do we face our consequences?*"

## deferring the consequences

The answer is we don't. We defer them as long as possible until the consequences slaps us in the face. Remember "*hindsight is always 20/20*". The problem being, at that point, it is all too late. Too much harm and too much farce had already been committed by the time the majority of people recognize "*this is bad*".
