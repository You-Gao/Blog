# The Clemons Series

The premise for this is simple: I get lost in an aisle and push the boundaries of my knowledge.[^1]

## AP.2
1. On The Digital Humanities
2. What Are The Arts And Sciences?
3. The Intellectual Life

## B.105
1. Food & Philosophy[^2] - DROPPED: just not for me
2. [Absent Body](https://blog.yougao.dev/books/absent-body/)
3. The Vocation of Writing - SKIPPED: more linguistic stuff
4. Intentionality - SKIPPED: see above
5. The Knowledge Illusion - DROPPED: social constructivism lite + cognitive biases
