  Environmental Dissonance
---
What do you when you are out of tune with your environment? That what I want to answer. We have heard of the idea of cognitive dissonance, where you believe one thing but continue to contradict that. So what happens when you are in contradiction with your environment?

I think the first reaction for me is that of course being in contradiction with society is a bad thing right. If you are a night owl that stays up at night and goes to sleep in the daytime. It would seem to be entirely unbeneficial for the person. They miss out on the things important to life, specifically being albe to interact with society. This behavior would usually lead to social isolation and being unable to fulfill daily contracts.

This same question has been asked in psychology literature before, because there are a valuable set of people that requires them to have schedules out of sync. These people are dubbed: night shifters/workers. They faced the symptoms I have drawn out in the earlier chapters which is an incredible amount of social isolation. A thing I missed out on though was the real biological timings humans have to interact with the environment. Messing up circadian rhythyms will invariably mess you up biologically.

* After reading about these, I realize I don't need to continue on writing.
