# Anatomy of a Quote

What makes a quote good? I don't know, but hopefully at the end of this blog I do. 

My .bashrc contains a script to print out a quote besides other things when I first load up my terminal. The quote list itself is a hodgepodge of many many quote .txt files I searched through so there isn't any centralized theme to them, besides they are "deep?". Everytime, I open up my terminal I get a pretty thought-provoking quote before working on code or writing this blog. But I wonder what is the structure of a good quote?

To give an idea of what they look like:

> It's not about how hard you can hit; it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
-- Rocky Balboa, Rocky

> To see things in the seed, that is genius.
-- Lao Tzu

>Iron rusts from disuse; water loses its purity from stagnation... even so does inaction sap the vigour of the mind.
-- Leonardo da Vinci

At first thought, I see three broad categories that a "good" quote can be fall under: motivational, insightful, and reflective. Sort of like the main "susbtance" of a quote; what the "good stuff" is in a quote. Then you have the linguistic structure; how many words it uses, how does it flow, etc. which rely on the rhetorical skills of the quotee. Another key factor of a good quote is probably the writer of the quote. Maybe it is wrong, but who the person is and is not definitely adds a sort of weight to the quote. 

In the end though, the **crucial** aspect is how much the quote and its idea aligns with our point-of-view. If what is a quote is treated as either what is beautiful or what is true; Then field of ethics and aesthetics would for the most apart agree with me on wht a good quote is: "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" and "there are no universal ethical truths".[^1]

Take the da Vinci or Rocky quote. Both of them motivate towards a go-getting and move forward attitude. As a motivating forth, that is perfectly fine to me right? Go you! But; taking quotes beyond face-level gives me a sense of unease. The da Vinci quote make good points about needing to be in flux. But what about the importance of rest da Vinci? Inaction need not be negative.

Borrowing from ethics, these motivational quotes tend to be normative statements. Normative statements are ones where it prescribes what you ought to do. Rocky says to get back up and persevere. Da Vinci says to be active in life. Why? Because it is virtuous to do so. The other type is called positive statements. These statements describe or say something of the world. Laozi's quote is a positive statement. It describes what a genius is and the functions of a genius. 

Given that distinction, I think the most dangerous of the two are normative quotes.
