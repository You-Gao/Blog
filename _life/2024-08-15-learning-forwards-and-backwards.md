  Learning Forwards and Backwards
---
In Plato's Meno, there is a passage on recollection which goes: ""For if you believe, as I do, that all learning is but recollection, then it follows that learning is not a matter of getting new information, but of remembering what the soul already knows."

The fact of learning and gathering new facts about the world (epistemology) has been a highlighy productive field of human thought. I am entering it's world to summarize my own position on how learning operates and the different perspectives a person can orient them when needing to learn. Taking from the already popularized dichotomies of know-how vs. know-that, tacit vs explicit, and known unknown vs unknown unknowns. I will see if I can use that to argue the ways in which we can gather knowledge on a topic and draw out where you would use a specific method of learning.

### Learning Forward

Before making the argument of learning backwards, I need to address the question of how people pick-up base facts to extrapolate upon. These are the base facts you need before going further in conceptual depth. Ideas such as Newton's Laws and many other empirical facts would fall under the category. And besides needing to figure it out yourselves many other intelligent people in humainty's past has collected and archived that base observational knowledge to consume. So it begins textbooks, readings, and onwards until you have enough facts in relation to each other that cognitive models are created on topics. 

* I'd like to go on a tangent for epistemic trust and truth, but I will save that

### Learning Backward

Alas, after you have lived in the world and gathered a suite of ontologies; you can then start learning by going backwards. My idea of learning backwards is parallel to the idea of learning by analogy. To teach someone how multithreading and async works, you likely wouldn't start immediately on sync mechanisms or spawning processes. I think the sane approach would be to give an analogy to working in a project and how people are able to work on different things simultaneously, but also the scenarios where you need to wait for someone.It just seems more effective in conveying information as the models for interaction are already there. They could then "work backwards" to understand the specific technical details on how multitheading is accomplished.

In many high-information systems, learning backwards would be the main way if you think you have pre-existing models that match the ontology you are trying to learn (which is the case most of the time). On the other hand, if you know nothing about the specifics of the system or how they relate to each other, than it will be an incredibly inefficient way to attempt in guess-working your way to ground truth / understanding. Take the example of trying to understand a watch. I know that the motors interact mechanically with each other in such a way that the parts within in the watch moves to keep track of time. If I were to open a watch up, I would be completly lost because of how much intricate fine-tuned decisions that were made in putting together the watch. 

** Note: Found a paper to basically confirmation bias what I came up with by Kolb, here is a screenshot of a section.
