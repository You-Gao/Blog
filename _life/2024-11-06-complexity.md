# Revisiting Complexity Theory

> Pre-print to think through my ideas and dive into this 

## Chaos & Gleick

Chaos and Gleick, the idea that simple rules can create non-linear systems, initial conditions create vast outcomes, and the discrete/continuous nature which makes it harder to calculate on or even say they are valid long-term predictors

## Undecidability & Turing

## Incompleteness & Godel

The idea that logic in math, philosophy, or computer science has fundamental problems that it can't solve. and can get compacted when going into complex systems with linear logic / rationalization. Chaos theory and it's application use a lot more of a bounded onto-epistemlogical approach to information than logic commits to metaphysically.

## Untheory of Everything 

A play on the physcists theory of everything, but moreso applied to the natural world. The world of abstractions and underlying systems that fundamentally do end up at some fundamental hardware (though this is contested in the theory of consciousness). UnTheory and complexity theory highlight that there are essentially multiple levels and transitions between worlds beyond the material level. This leads to different culturs, ways of being and experiencening, fields of thought, and general diversity in a broad scope.
