# free time

What is a person to do with "*free time*"? I finally cleared out my reading list of unread things along with the continual queue of new ideas to reflect on. The particular books were *Desining Data-Intesive Systems*, a book on *Kubernetes*, a book on *Docker*, and *Post Growth: Life After Capitalism*.

I've usually operated the past month or so in a continual flood of things I wanted to deep-dive, but since the water has retreated, I wonder what should I do. Of course I have class work that I have perpetually procrastinated on so there's that. I also have full confidence in myself eventually getting distracted in the near future so the best prescription is therefore to breathe & enjoy the silence.
