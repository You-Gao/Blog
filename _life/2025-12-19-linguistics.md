# linguistics and the such

It has been an odd half-year for me. My mind has been oddly focused on understanding language and it has not stopped since. Not language as in the english grammar, but "*general semantics*" and "*syntax*". I felt like you could trace through my blogs in all of the categories and find that understanding language was at the core of most of them. "*art interpretation*", "*wittegenstein*", "*data ethics*",even the one about philosophers on physics, comments on the "*self*", and the rest of this year's collection really did focus on language.

And when I'm saying "*language*", I don't mean just the english language or the spoken language, I would have exhausted my enthusiam for it. But it has been moreso about what are symbols, what is meaning, in the area of "*mathematical formalism*", but also in the sense of "*self*". Which has now transitioned to formalism in programming languages i.e. "*Prolog*" and "*Scala*". With the main goal in answering what is "*representation*" and what is "*computation*", which again circles back to using and understanding language.

Maybe it's because I have been going in circles that I haven't able to escape the topic.

I still don't think that machines can think.
