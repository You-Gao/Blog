Having been at college and finishing out fall semester for my 3rd year, I do ponder a lot if it was worth it. Even moreso having already completed my computer science degree in the two years, was it "worth" staying and getting the second major in Global Development Studies. Evaluating myself from a mainstream audience, I presume the answer is no. The line of reasoning would be my career earnings etc. etc. with it hinging upon a monetary argument. That is how much money does a person with a Global Development Studies degree command on the market. And I don't necessarily disagree with that thought in the practical sense, but it does bake in some assumptions about education that I wouldn't advocate myself. The assumption is: you should educate yourself so you can get paid. That assumption is probably why a lot of people derisively use the term "liberal arts" as a caricature for a group of people. You know..., the barista, out-of-touch intellectual, social justice warrior, or hipster. But, the main question I ask is if the liberal arts world sees the world differently? Though, just as importantly. 

Taking a quote from Steve Jobs []:
> "It's technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that makes our hearts sing".

Going back to my 2nd major. I kind of want to defend the "Studies" portion in the name. Safe to say, any field that ends with Studies is treated as a heurestic for "useless", atleast economically. And to that I say true. Economic output, insofar as being able to produce, commodified, and marketed as some "thing" is not the goal of such majors. But even then there is a sort of cultural devaluing of it right? I mean, compared to social intuitions around politics majors, they are clearly more favored over the "Studies". Why is that? We are all working with the same socio-political-economical-historical raw materials right? My answer to this lies again on the point of practically, in this case cultural and instituional practicality. Politics/Polisci has a well-defined career path and instituions it engages with as a discipline. In constrast, what is the "Studies" as practice if not just critique? [] The difference is illuminating of what methodologically needs to change, if not the field, but maybe of me, the student. 

From Gramsci on the modern intellectual:
> "The mode of being of the new intellectual can no longer consist of eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover of feelings and passions, but in active participation in practical life, as constructor [and] organizer, as "permanent persuader", not just simple orator.

In other words, simply:
>"Practice what you preach"[]

You don't to wait until "the revolution comes" in order to practice mindfully living. 

## The Tier List

Wow, I have somehow made a post about a silly tier list, into a reflection on the value/aesthetics of knowledge and how that maps on to discussions of our political and economical life. Am I becoming boring? 

Anyhows here is the fun part where I explain why I put the classes into those tiers and why even those tiers. The direction will be from the lowest to highest tier. 

### Irrelevant

It's blank.I don't think any class I have tooken was wholly irrelevant and divorced from the world.

### I Was on My computer

STAT2120: Intro to Statistics. I never went to class. I passed with an A. 

### Could Have Been Better 

Queer Theory and Asian American Studies not bad, I just took them at the wrong point in time. 

Data Ethics was interesting, but I don't think the class as a whole "cared".

EGMTs is interesting, but only if you got to chose the one you wanted. I didn't and although it was not the worse, I was just waiting for the class to end most days.

The class on Plato, was too early in the morning, I didn't apply myself as well. Also taking a 3000s Philosophy class as a first-year was an interesting move by me.

### Career Mileage or Great

Of course, all of my CS classes contribute to the knowledge I would need as a computer scientist. And a lot of the elective courses are fun. The two technical ones I am taking this semester is compilers and defense against the dark arts, which brings together all the knowledge from the core curriculi meaningfully.

EGMT 1520: Making Medicines Good was a fun dive into the structures of a public research university and what that means for the students in it. It also talked about the pharmaceutical industry, shady practices, and the future prospects of such. 

BME 1501: Advancing Equitable Solutions was an enjoyable elective that considered a simple thing, who does a technology benefit and who does it not? 

EGMT 1510: Are Oldies Goodies? Watched movies and wrote critically about them, what is there not to like.

### I Learned as a Person 

These courses challenged my personal philosophy and worldview in some way.

Data Visualization and Performing Archives asked me to rethink the importance of the senses, specifically sight and touch. The raw materials of experiencing stimuli is important as much as reflection/theorizing. 

PHIL 1330; Virtual World and Philosophy was a fun course. Broad introduction to many branches of philosophy while considering quesions we have all thought before like: Are we in the Matrix?

CS 1110: Intro to Programming was my first dive into programming. I think I'm somewhat good at it, but this course set off my course on understanding compuation, writing code, and programming.

CS 3100 and CS 3130 were not life-changing in themselves, but moreso that I took 5 of these terminal core coursesin a semester as a "limit-test". How much technical knowledge and abstractions can I learn in a semester while being able to live life? I learned a lot, of the knowledge, but mostly of what I can handle. Of course I put them here for a reason other than that which is they addressed fundamental problems of computations that is the theoretical limits and the core low-level constructs. 

Global Development Studies. I would have immediately dropped it if I felt like I was not learning anything, but unsurprisingly I have.
