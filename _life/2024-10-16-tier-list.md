Having been at college and finishing out fall semester for my 3rd year, I do ponder a lot if it was worth it. Even moreso having already completed my computer science degree in the two years, was it "worth" staying and getting the second major in Global Development Studies. Evaluating myself from a mainstream audience, I presume the answer is no. The line of reasoning would be my career earnings etc. etc. with it hinging upon a monetary argument. That is how much money does a person with a Global Development Studies degree command on the market. And I don't necessarily disagree with that thought in the practical sense, but it does bake in some assumptions about education that I wouldn't advocate myself. The assumption is: you should educate yourself so you can get paid. That assumption is probably why a lot of people derisively use the term "liberal arts" as a caricature for a group of people. You know..., the barista, out-of-touch intellectual, social justice warrior, or hipster. But, the main question I ask is if the liberal arts world sees the world differently? Though, just as importantly. 

Taking a quote from Steve Jobs []:
> "It's technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that makes our hearts sing".

Going back to my 2nd major. I kind of want to defend the "Studies" portion in the name. Safe to say, any field that ends with Studies is treated as a heurestic for "useless", atleast economically. And to that I say true. Economic output, insofar as being able to produce, commodified, and marketed as some "thing" is not the goal of such majors. But even then there is a sort of cultural devaluing of it right? I mean, compared to social intuitions around politics majors, they are clearly more favored over the "Studies". Why is that? We are all working with the same socio-political-economical-historical raw materials right? My answer to this lies again on the point of practically, in this case cultural and instituional practicality. Politics/Polisci has a well-defined career path and instituions it engages with as a discipline. In constrast, what is the "Studies" as practice if not just critique? [] The difference is illuminating of what methodologically needs to change, if not the field, but maybe of me, the student. 

From Gramsci on the modern intellectual:
> "The mode of being of the new intellectual can no longer consist of eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover of feelings and passions, but in active participation in practical life, as constructor [and] organizer, as "permanent persuader", not just simple orator.

In other words, simply:
>"Practice what you preach"[]

You don't to wait until "the revolution comes" in order to practice mindfully living.
