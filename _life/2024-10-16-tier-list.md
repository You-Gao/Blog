Having been at college and finishing out fall semester for my 3rd year, I do ponder a lot if it was worth it. Even moreso having already completed my computer science degree in the two years, was it "worth" staying and getting the second major in Global Development Studies. Evaluating myself from a mainstream audience, I presume the answer is no. The line of reasoning would be my career earnings etc. etc. with it hinging upon a monetary argument. That is how much money does a person with a Global Development Studies degree command on the market. And I don't necessarily disagree with that thought in the practical sense, but it does bake in some assumptions about education that I wouldn't advocate myself. The assumption is: you should educate yourself so you can get paid. That assumption is probably why a lot of people derisively use the term "liberal arts" as a caricature for a group of people. You know..., the barista, out-of-touch intellectual, social justice warrior, or hipster. But, the main question I ask is if the liberal arts world sees the world differently? Though, just as importantly. 

Taking a quote from Steve Jobs []:
> "It's technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that makes our hearts sing".
