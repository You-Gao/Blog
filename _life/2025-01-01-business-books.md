# How to Find "Good" Business Books

As it is the day after New Year, I reflected on my reading journey and became so *deeply* afflicted[^1] by the fact that I haven't read a share of good business books. But there was another problem. The field of business is different than the books related to the term "business," which are usually written in appeal to the "pop-business" audience. That is the current literature that you get when searching top business books on Amazon discusses the practical virtues of a business person, the surface-level psychology (probably on the "grindset"), and broad organizational "stuff". There is good content there, but it felt like there was something off; no way business as a field is just this.

Based on my intuition, I decided to do some research on if business was more than that. The answer is yes. Business as a field is so much more than the books people tout or advertise with the sort of 3D rendered, really visually uninteresting book covers[^2]. Business as a field also covers topics like the theory of institutional actors (firms, markets, consumers, etc.), organizational efficiency, market analysis, ethics, and probably more. However, the critique here is that you would be better off studying to be an economist, sociologist/anthropologist, or even philosopher as the "good" books: *The Theory of Industrial Organization*, *Democratizing Innovation*, *Organizational Culture and Leadership*, and so on is never assigned in an undergraduate business degree; maybe an MBA. The most you would engage with these books is having their ideas referenced in HBR articles the professor assigns, and that is a shame.

## The GBB Metric

My solution then is this: the GBB Metric. GBB is a Good Business Book. It is a pretty straightforward metric. I define it as the ratio of citations to Amazon or Goodreads reviews a book has. The rationale is that the "hidden gems" are vetted by the academic business community in direct contrast to the public received of a book. For example, *Thinking Fast and Slow* would be ~50,000/500,000, which is two magnitudes "better" than *48 Laws of Power* at 500/200,000. A "time-tested" book like *Competitive Strategy* would be higher than both at 75,000/15,000. However, this is just a heuristic, and it is probably not even the best one at that. However, with that in mind, go out there and read some books. Thanks for reading.
