# Mind Wandering and DMN

DMN, in the context of mind-wandering, sounds like a ubiquitous 21st-century drug to the uninitiated. But, it is actually the main functional group that scientists have pointed to in explaining the phenomena of many functions humans experience, like reflection, day-dreaming, streams-of-consciousness, and what I want to focus on here is mind-wandering.

Explaining why they believe it does so is pretty simple. A researcher decided to look at the fMRI scans of patients while they were not doing anything and discovered a pattern, which was then labeled the DMN (Default Mode Network).

Yeah, I thought I would have written more, but I don't think I have more to say other than summaries. 

- [Intentional vs. Unintentional Wandering](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5004739/)
    - Found that the DMN "*wandering*" can be both intentional or unintentional 
- [DMN Promotes Learning](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11047624/)     
    - Found that the "*resting network*" helps with learning as well
- [The Science of Mind-Wandering](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25293689/) 
    - Comprehensive review of the topic (recommended if you want to read more)
