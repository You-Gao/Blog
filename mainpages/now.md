# now

The idea of a now page is nice, but it's always not "*up-to-date*" enough. So I'll give my best guess on what I'm up to.

It's an interesting question to ask myself. What is my life? What will I be doing in the future? The best answer I have is I'll be somewhere; in my bed, on a beach, under a bridge, doing the same thing: getting way too lost in thought.

Besides that, I'm still a college student and don't have a full-time j\*b yet or I would have put that here. I would hope that I still enjoy doing stuff with computers unless we have Skynet by then. 

Given my projected career path, I will probably be studying up on topics and toolings related to DevOps, SRE, Platform, Architecture, etc. I do also have interests in web-design and app-dev, which keeping sharp would never inhinge the main path.

Aside from work related things, I'm probably playing a newly released indie rogue-lite or some ArcSys or FromSoft title. I also definitely have atleast 5 books I could be reading instead of gaming.

At this point, if you are still curious, leave an email: [inbox@yougao.dev](mailto:hello@yougao.dev).
