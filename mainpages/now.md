# now [{{ 'now' | date: '%D' }}]

The idea of a now page is nice, but it's always not "*up-to-date*" enough. So I have decided to use as many APIs and widgets as I can to give you the most, newest, and greatest information of what I've been up too!

For the ones that need updating, I'll "*try*" to stay on top of it.

## My Life

It's an interesting question to ask myself. What is my life, discarding Goodreads, Yelp, Github, and Spotify? The best answer I have is I'll be somewhere; in my bed, on a beach, under a bridge, doing the same thing: getting way too lost in thought.

Besides that, I'm still a college student and don't have a full-time j\*b yet or I would have put that here. I would hope that I still enjoy doing stuff with computers unless we have Skynet by then. 

Given my projected career path, I will probably be studying up on topics and toolings related to DevOps, SRE, Platform, Architecture, etc. I do also have interests in web-design and app-dev, which keeping sharp would never inhinge the main path.

At this point, if you are still curious, leave an email: [inbox@yougao.dev](mailto:hello@yougao.dev).
