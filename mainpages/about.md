## why are you writing?

the reason i started this blog was to explore the random thoughts i had in mind. for any blog post then, were written because they contained ideas which were interesting, perplexing maybe, usually existential, or funny; enough so that it warranted me spending time to write about it.

## motifs?

the blog was categorized into motifs (fun, text, me, work, img) as they were things i frequently encounter throughout my life. within each motif you will find posts containing my reflections and perspectives on whatever idea i have decided to blabber about. and if i turn out to be a decent blogger, there is something tangible to takeaway. 

enjoy the site, no matter how you have stumbled onto this crevice of the internet.

## should you blog?

there are existing lists of online sources for this, but i thought it'd be fun to compile my own:
