# about me 

<img src=" {{ 'assets/home/bundled_me.jpg' | absolute_url}}" class="img-fluid" alt="...">

## who are you?

i go by you. the logo Ué«˜, is just my first and last name (you gao). i'll try to give a comprehensive answer to this by stating my preferences and hopefully that gives you insight into how i see the world.

i enjoy minimalism, almost to a fault. my favorite art movement is bauhaus. i would consider myself a constructive empiricist. favorite flavor of anything is mango. i made spare money as a teen by selling items on popular mmos. studying computer science and global development "*studies*" in college. comfort show is family guy. smiling friends enjoyer.

## why are you writing?

the reason i started this blog was to explore the random thoughts i had in mind. for any blog post then, were written because they contained ideas which were interesting, perplexing maybe, usually existential, or funny; enough so that it warranted me spending time to write about it.

## why the selection?

the blog was categorized into motifs (fun, books, me, work, img) as they were things i frequently encounter throughout my life. within each motif you will find posts containing my reflections and perspectives on whatever idea i have decided to blabber about. and if i turn out to be a decent blogger, there is something tangible to takeaway. 

enjoy the site, no matter how you have stumbled onto this crevice of the internet.

## should you blog?

there are existing lists for this, but i thought it'd be fun to compile my own:
- [mini essays to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi8meiPUt84)
- [start making cool shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXf10rw_dqo&pp=ygUObWFrZSBjb29sIHNoaXTSBwkJ3gkBhyohjO8%3D)
- [brain dumps](https://btxx.org/posts/dump/)
