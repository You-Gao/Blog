# about me 

<img src=" {{ 'assets/home/bundled_me.jpg' | absolute_url}}" class="img-fluid" alt="...">

## why are you writing?

the reason i started this blog was to explore the random thoughts i had in mind. for any blog post then, were written because they contained ideas which were interesting, perplexing maybe, usually existential, or funny; enough so that it warranted me spending time to write about it.

## why the selection?

the blog was categorized into motifs (fun, books, me, work, img) as they were things i frequently encounter throughout my life. within each motif you will find posts containing my reflections and perspectives on whatever idea i have decided to blabber about. and if i turn out to be a decent blogger, there is something tangible to takeaway. 

enjoy the site, no matter how you have stumbled onto this crevice of the internet.

## should you blog?

there are existing lists of online sources for this, but i thought it'd be fun to compile my own:
* [mini essays to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi8meiPUt84)
* [start making cool shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXf10rw_dqo&pp=ygUObWFrZSBjb29sIHNoaXTSBwkJ3gkBhyohjO8%3D)
* [brain dumps](https://btxx.org/posts/dump/)
