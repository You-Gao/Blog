# about me 

<img src=" {{ 'assets/home/bundled_me.jpg' | absolute_url}}" class="img-fluid" alt="...">

## who are you?

I go by you. The logo, Ué«˜, is just my first and last name (you gao). I'll try to give a comprehensive answer to this by stating my preferences, and hopefully, that will give you insight into how I see the world.

I enjoy minimalism---almost to a fault. My favorite art movement is Bauhaus. I would consider myself a constructive empiricist. My favorite flavor of anything is mango. I made spare money as a teen by selling items on popular MMOs. Studying computer science and global development "*studies*" in college. Comfort show is a *Family Guy.* *Smiling Friends* enjoyer.

## why are you writing?

The reason I started this blog was to explore the random thoughts I had in mind. Any blog post then was written because it contained ideas that were interesting, perplexing, maybe, usually existential, or funny; enough so that it warranted me spending time to write about it.

## why the selection?

The blog was categorized into motifs (fun, books, me, work, images) as they were things I frequently encounter throughout my life. Within each motif, you will find posts containing my reflections and perspectives on whatever idea I have decided to blabber about. and if I turn out to be a decent blogger, there is something tangible to take away. 

Enjoy the site, no matter how you have stumbled onto this crevice of the internet.

## should you blog?

There are existing lists for this, but I thought it'd be fun to compile my own:
- [mini essays to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi8meiPUt84)
- [start making cool shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXf10rw_dqo&pp=ygUObWFrZSBjb29sIHNoaXTSBwkJ3gkBhyohjO8%3D)
- [brain dumps](https://btxx.org/posts/dump/)
