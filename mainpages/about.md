## who are <u>you</u>?[^1]

I go by you. The logo, Ué«˜, is just my first and last name (you gao). I'll try to give a comprehensive answer to "*who i am*" by stating my preferences along with some factoids and letting you do the work of psychoanalyzing me.

### preferences 
* I like [fighting games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_game).
* I like [autochess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_battler).
* [Snorlax](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/snorlax) is my favorite pokemon.
* Favorite aesthetic is [minimalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism).
* Favorite art movement is Bauhaus.
* Favorite flavor of anything is mango. 
* Coke over Pepsi.
* Cats over dogs.

### factoids
* I would consider myself a [constructive empiricist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constructive-empiricism/). 
* I made spare money as a teen by selling items on popular MMOs.
* Majored computer science and [global development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_studies) "*studies*".
* I've watched *Smiling Friends* s1-s2 many times.
* Spotify says I listen to 60+ genres.
* I own 5+ mechanical keyboards.

## why are you writing?

The reason I started this blog was to explore the random thoughts I had. Any blog post then was written because it contained ideas that were interesting, perplexing, and usually existential, or funny; enough so that it warranted me spending time to write about it.

## why the selection?

The blog was categorized into motifs (fun, books, me, work, images) as they were things I frequently encounter throughout my life. Within each motif, you will find posts containing my reflections and perspectives on whatever idea I have decided to blabber about. and if I turn out to be a decent blogger, there is something tangible to take away. 

Enjoy the site, no matter how you have stumbled onto this crevice of the internet.

## should you blog?

There are existing lists for this, but I thought it'd be fun to compile my own:
- [mini essays to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi8meiPUt84)
- [start making cool shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXf10rw_dqo&pp=ygUObWFrZSBjb29sIHNoaXTSBwkJ3gkBhyohjO8%3D)
- [brain dumps](https://btxx.org/posts/dump/)

[^1]: Writing an about me is hard because I think the [nature of the self](https://plato.stanford.edu/archIves/fall2024/entries/self-knowledge/supplement.html) isn't fixed.
