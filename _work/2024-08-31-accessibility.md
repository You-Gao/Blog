The workshop was delivered via presentation. The presenter went through some slides and talked about the different non-text elements available and deciding on which ones should have alt-text, but also when the alt-text should be applied. 


## Reflection

Recently, I took a workshop in digital accessibility. I always wanted to learn more about accessibility as it is often neglected because **most** people that use the internet are all able-bodied. This mindset towards accessibility, in fact, does heavily impact ways in which people make the internet and strays from the point that the internet should be usable for all. From the workshop itself, we were taught about the general non-text element functions in HTML to enable screen readers. These were the standard set of aria-labels, figcaptions, and headers. What was interesting in particular is that there are design patterns set in place to make the screen reader parse the HTML better. I was kind of glad at how even though digital accessibility is heavily neglected, there is still some work done in trying to make the internet marginally better. An example was placing an image in a div with the aria-text saying please go to header x for more information, then the header would contain the actual text for the image. Doing some of my own research, there could be better solutions out there as well, with updates to aria-label.

Besides from what I learned on digital accessibility, I want to make the case that designing towards digital accessibility and building it into the internet will benefit everyone, not only those who are not temporarily able-bodied. Accessability and usability are mutually beneficial concepts. Going off that, I want to list technologies that were made to address accessibility but have been used by everyone. Speech technology (car GPS, search results), e-books, and closed captions are a small grouping of the vast variety of everyday technology we gained from addressing accessibility. Just as when the wheelchair door button saves you in moments where you are carrying things or extremely tired, practical accessibility implementations may help all users of the internet.

As I researched the topic more, I became disheartened, as I knew it's not a major focus because the category of "disabled" is neccessarily marginal to a business. Although thats why modern disability studies have pushed the term temporary able-bodied against the dichotomy of able vs. disabled. Anyways accessibility is cool, but there is also a reason why it's not focused on, but should that be the case?
