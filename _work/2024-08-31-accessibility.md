Recently, took a workshop in digital accessibility as I always wanted to learn more, but often neglected it as most people that use the internet are all able-bodied. This mindset infact does heavily impact ways in which people interact with the internet, and makes the point that the powerful technology of the internet should be able usable for all. From the workshop itself, we were taught about the general non-text element functions in html to enable screen readers. These were the standard set of aria-labels, figcaptions, and headers. What was interesting in particular is that there were actually design patterns set in place to make the screen-reader parse the html better. An example was placing an image in a div with the aria-text saying please go to header x for more information, then the header would contain the actual text for the image. Doing some of my own research, there could be better solutions out there as well, with updates to aria-label.

Besides from what I learned on digital accessibility, I want to make the case that designing towards digital accessibility and building it into the internet will benefit everyone, not only those who are not able-bodied. Accessability and Usability are mutually benefitting concepts, as stated in the design of everyday things by Norman. Going off that, I want to list and maybe reimagine technologies that were made to address accessibility, but have been used by everyone. Speech technology (car gps, search results), E-books, and Closed Captions are a small grouping of the vast variety of everyday technology we gained from addressing accessibility. Just as when the wheelchair door button saves you in moments where you are carrying things or extremely tired; practical accessibility implementations may help the able-bodied users of the internet.

As researching the topic more, I become disheartened as I knew it's not a major focus because the category of "disabled" is neccessary marginal to a businesses. Although thats why modern disabilities study have pushinng the term temporary able-bodied against the dichotomy of able vs disabled.
