# The Neovim Setup

Posts of this nature is essentially the computer science version of a GWRM video.Instead of the daily routine of what a person does getting ready to the day, we decide to showcase the ways in which an app on our computer that we stare at for the day looks like. So, I decided to write about mine.

After a bit of spring cleaning, nuking my previous nvim and finally reading the documentation, I am proud to write about the configs I have chosen. The funny thing being, in the time I took to understand nvim lua modules and lazy.nvim, I could have simply installed Lazy or mini which would have saved me _a lot_ of time. Nevertheless, I decided to craft my own config in virtue of "using what I choose".

## Treesitter/LSP

The main part of the set-up for things that do most of the heavy work. You have the syntactical analysis with Treesitter and the semantic analysis with LSP. With treesitter you get useful keymaps to navigate the classes and functions inside the current buffer. With different LSP you get code completion, snippets, and go-to-defs. Both immensly useful for navigating, understanding, and modifying code.

### nvim.cmp

Integrates with the lsp to actually provide the said completion and snippets feature.

## nvim-lint/conform

Two code cleaniness checkers. I've always wondered if the LSP could provide linting or not and they can also do that, but for the purpose of a linter or formatter they usually are only ran on BufReadPre. And I do think some LSP servers already do send back diagnostics that are displayed. The merit to these tools then is for either a custom lint/format or non-semantic stuff.

## theme: catpuccin

I am a catpuccin supporter. I enjoy obsidian and the dull pastel color palette. The dark mode for this website implements the color scheme.

## lualine/bufferline

Interesting story here, adding these plugins made me switch to Alacritty. Urxvt did not support emoji displays so I had my hand-forced to install a terminal that did. These plugins are just there for ui, they are visually appealing and organizes useful information well.

## neotree

In my original install, I never knew off the nvim plugin world which meant that I was only working with :Explore and using other nvim commands for filesystem operations. I truly thank myself for discovering neotree. Very useful and how good functionalities.

## neogit

I can do git commands in nvim!

## toggleterm

I can open a terminal in nvim!

## overseer

I can run tasks in nvim!

## which-key

A useful plugin that reminds you of what you can do after you chord a key.

## telescope

Still exploring the vast potentials of telescope, will report back.
