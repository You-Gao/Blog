# Layer 8 DDOS and AI[^1]

The concept of a Layer 8 DDOS is based on the "*OSI Model*." Traditionally, DDoS or DOS attacks are aimed at specific layers within the OSI model with the goal of consuming all available resources. Taking some creative liberty here, "*Layer 8*" refers to the person behind the computer.

So, suppose you have a ticketing system that receives support requests from users. With widespread access to AI, it is feasible to overload a ticketing system with questionably genuine support requests sent from different email addresses and IP addresses. The result is that human operators processing the tickets will spend a lot of time trying to resolve the "*dubious tickets.*"

Aside from the evilness of the act, how would a company even set up safeguards for such an "*attack*"? They would need to discern whether the person creating the data is a bot or not. I'm sure that there would be literature on this because I don't think it is a novel problem. Before this new threat, a person could easily affect the A/B testing of a website by setting up bots to do random things on the website. 

What initially comes to mind are some basic heuristics that might be able to filter out certain tickets, such as user metrics, CAPTCHA, and other behavioral characteristics. However, I'm not entirely sure that those heuristics would hold strong enough to deter a bad actor from actively breaking them.

Yeah, that's the end of the blog. I'm not too sure of any enduring strategies against this, but maybe you have some ideas. Open-source communities are facing the same problem due to bug bounties and the submission of completely bogus pull requests.

Fun and depressing random note: Any "*bot*" or "*bad faith actor*" can be seen as a DOS attempt on society. It takes time and context to verify if something being put out is actually true or not. Also the reason why most people have incredible distrust in any news source.
