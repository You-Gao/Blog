# Deep Work

I picked up this book after reflecting on my own over-use of technology and ways to live "fuller". Reading the book was largely meant to reconfirm my reflections, which in-fact turned out to be correct or atleast similar to its contents. Newport basically makes the distinction between deep and shallow work as one of cognitive demand. Deep work is the work that requires distraction-free environments and rather difficult; it relates to the idea of flow if you are similar with that. Shallow work is the kind of work that requires least efforts, similar to the idea of busy work. Part 1 of the book details more of the pragmatic arguments for deep work on how it is beneficial and hard to come by. I don't think I need to restate that argument, so for Part 1 I will focus on the interesting part, which is why deep work is meaningful. Part 2 of the book writes on rules to achieving deep work and provides some arguments related to the rules. What I highlight for Part 2 is the discussion of Bimodal Philosophy (Basically Work-Life Balance), Rituals, and other Tips to achieve deep-work.

What I will write on is highly related to previous blog posts I wrote on Digital Hedonism, Experience of Time, My Productivity Set-up, and Software Design. 
I'll link those under here for now.

## Part 1: The Ideas

CH1 and CH2 cover the topics of why deep work is rare and valuable. I feel like largely everyone can agree with that presupposition. What I feel is more in contention is CH3 which focuses on the finding meaning in deep work. There is the discussion on neurological based on the concept of "fire together, wire together" and psychological based on "flow". The interesting discussion for me was on self-meaning, Descartes' skepticism, and craftsmanship. The argument is similar to Nietzsche's "God is dead!" proclamation, which generally highlights the lost in meaning from previous institutions mainly religious. This loss of meaning has cast humanity into existential anxiety and we must now cope with the consequences. The point Dreyfus tries to illustrate is that instead of a self-existential meaning found in the context of ones-self, people can find a self-detached purpose of creation for the sake of a field. I think there is a beauty in that as an alternative, because it offers the out to just focusing on developing your own meaning (even if it subjective), but still realizing there is a greater purpose out in the world. 

Beautiful code is short and concise, so if you were to give that code to
another programmer they would say, “oh, that’s well written code.” It’s
much like as if you were writing a poem.

Reflecting on the quote, you can see why there is a sense of craftsmanship to it. I think of software design very much as an abstraction capturing process similar to math in defining mathematical representations of the world. It is the same when determining the aesthetic qualities for software; it only feels so related to practicality because there is a sense in which the reader of code knows how the expert has captured the abstraction. This mirrors the idea that deep work is not merely about productivity but about engaging with tasks in a way that transcends mere functionality, touching on the essence of creativity and mastery. 

Currently reading through the pragmatic programmer so if you want to hear more on the aesthetics and a philosophy of software engineers, head here:

Also sometimes craftmanship isn't all about the abstractions in as much as knowing how to manipulate and control them (definition of an engineer?):
- Donut Circle Code
- Some Random 100000x Bespoke Design

## Part 2: The Rules

Part 2 is sectioned off into 4 rules (Work Deeply, Embrace Boredom, Quit Social Media, and Drain the Shallows) and delves into the whys and hows for achieving them.

### Work Deeply and Embrace Boredom
Segments on Bimodal Philosophy of Jung relates to my productivity set-up


### Quit Social Media and Drain the Shallows
Segments on living life fully and how the internet impacts it
