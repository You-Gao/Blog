# Adam Smith's Physical Hand

cover the idea of philosophers and economists until the gilded age. specifically cover the usage of adam smith to tie back into the modern economists, but also justify liberal political positions. then transition to the shenanigans that occured during the gilded age and just enjoy economic dogmatism takin to it's extreme

The Gilded Age is a period of American history we all heard about in middle school history class. We learned about the magnates, robber barons, journalists, state powers, and the worker exploitation that occured. We have all seen the political cartoon where you have all the workers lifting up fat magnates. However, I don't think we as kids were really thinking about class consciousness or the operations of the political world. Which alas leads to today; I'm less of a kid now and my attention has been turned back on these topics.

** Note: John Stuart Mill was a kid that did.

The title of this blog then, is a two-part critique of the moral bankruptcy during the Gilded Age and the use of economic doctrine to justify/strengthen those positions of power. Adam Smith's concept of the invisible hand becomes physical. That is, the economic and market mechanisms divined by the invisible hand is no longer abstract and beautiful. It has been cast out of the garden and is now in the hands of us humans. I look back to the Gilded Age as a case study precisely because it was a point in time where economic dogmatism was at its peak and its effects most destructive.

Some would say I'm cherry-picking or misconstruing the "true" power of economics and to that I say maybe I am. But what's important is my agenda that positivist mathematical economics is sadly not free from human fallibility (a year ago I definitely wanted it to be). I want to start considering again the political part of economics which was dropped at the turn of the 19th century in favor for what we have today in the 21st century.

** Note: Adam Smith only wrote the words "invisible hand" 1 time in the entirety of Wealth of Nations. The book that made Smith popular during his era was actually The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Adam Smith then can be said to be colloquially "rolling in his grave" whenever his ideas are brought-up.

## Economists in the Gilded Age 

Did any respectful economist sound the alarm? In an era we now view as having manufactured monopolies, exploitation, and incredible inequality. Did any economist see a problem with what was going on? Was there no cognitive dissonance at all? The reactions the economic orthodox would've given then was something like this: 

- J.P. Morgan wasn't bad he was just an enterprising individual.
- Wow look the jobs all of these magnates are creating.
- Look at the free market doing its thing.
- The people who made it to the top were just better market competitors.
- People have to right to use their money however they want to.

I mean to really get a sense of the economic zeitgeist, look no further than Yale's 1st economist William Graham Sumner. Here is a quote from his 1883 book "What Social Classes Owe to Each Other":

> Hence, those who today enjoy the most complete emancipation from the hardships of human life, and the greatest command over the conditions of existence, simply show us the best that man has yet been able to do. Can we all reach that standard by wishing for it? Can we all vote it to each other? If we pull down those who are most for-tunate and successful, shall we not by that very act defeat our own object? 

There's already a clear undertone of Social Darwinism there. But it does make sense when you are considering the doctrine of liberalism. Free individual -> Free Markets -> Laisezz Faire. So really, who cares about the people that "failed"? It's the impersonal mechanisms of the market, sucks for you, but not for me. 

** Note: The more modern debate on this topic is the concept of Meritocracy, see the similarities?

This dogmatism is why I thought it'd be fun to examine what occured during the Gilded Age in light of it. Stepping back a bit. There definitely were dissenters like Veblin and the such, but the dominating intellectual forces gravitated towards apathy and minutiae. I think I have made my point on economics ability to enable cruelty clear.I want to move on to the more visceral and narrative argument against indexing the soul towards the profit motive.

## Rich Shenanigans

> It was not only in their neglect of the fine processes of the law that the Americans outdid their European contemporaries; when they fought, they abandoned the gentleman’s rapier for the roughneck’s brass knuckles (The Worldly Philosophers)

This section tells the many, almost absurd tales, that went on during the age of riches and expansion.

# Black Friday

The Black Friday we know well of today stems from the schemes of two magnates James Fisk and Jay Gould. Our modern-day experience of Black Friday is one of sales and cheap goods which benefits all consumers. The initial Black Friday was much more grim and had severe negative impacts on the American economy because the good devalued then was gold. So how did the gold crash and economic downturn come about? It rose from the desire and ability to financially manipulate the markets.

In the Gilded Ages, the United States was tied to the gold standard. The duo took advantage of the gold standard and devised a scheme to corner to gold market. The idea is, especially in a commodity market where there is significant demand, if they control the supply they can artificially inflate the price to their desired price levels. They also knew a little something about informational assymettry so they had to come up with a plan to execute their enters and exits anonymously. On top of this, they knew the government had gold reserves and was willing to prevent their cornerning of the gold market by selling their reserves at normal market prices.

Long-story short, they bribed a guy name Daniel Butterfield to kill two birds with one stone. Because Butterfield was the one executing trades for the U.S. government, he could provide intel to Fisk and Gould on any potential market transactions before it was done. The duo would also buy up gold in Butterfield's name as a way to cover their tracks. But, nothing really escapes the U.S. government. President Grant and his secrety of treasury pieced together their scheme and did what the duo was scared of; On September 24th 1869, Black Friday occured. The treasury sold off $4 million in gold to the market and the price of gold dipped which affected the price of many goods like wheat which went from $1.40 to $.77 a bushel.

** Note: This is an interesting case for nominal/real value, monetary theory, and the gold standard here that I want to dig into a bit more later.

# The Original Pump & Dump Scheme

** Note: I remember a funny bit in a lecture that said a good way to make money is become a fraud journalist, report a company to the SEC, and then short the stock.
