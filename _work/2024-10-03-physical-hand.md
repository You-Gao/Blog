# Adam Smith's Physical Hand

The Gilded Age is a period of American history we all heard about in middle school history class. We learned about the magnates, robber barons, journalists, state powers, and the worker exploitation that occured. We have all seen the political cartoon where you have all the workers lifting up fat magnates. However, I don't think we as kids were really thinking about class consciousness or the operations of the political world. Which alas leads to today; I'm less of a kid now and my attention has been turned back on these topics.

** Note: John Stuart Mill was a kid that did.

The title of this blog then, is a two-part critique of the moral bankruptcy during the Gilded Age and the use of economic doctrine to justify/strengthen those positions of power. Adam Smith's concept of the invisible hand becomes physical. That is, the economic and market mechanisms divined by the invisible hand is no longer abstract and beautiful. It has been cast out of the garden and is now in the hands of us humans. I look back to the Gilded Age as a case study precisely because it was a point in time where economic dogmatism was at its peak and its effects most destructive.

Some would say I'm cherry-picking or misconstruing the "true" power of economics and to that I say maybe I am. But what's important is my agenda that positivist mathematical economics is sadly not free from human fallibility (a year ago I definitely wanted it to be). I want to start considering again the political part of economics which was dropped at the turn of the 19th century in favor for what we have today in the 21st century.

** Note: Adam Smith only wrote the words "invisible hand" 1 time in the entirety of Wealth of Nations. The book that made Smith popular during his era was actually The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Adam Smith then can be said to be colloquially "rolling in his grave" whenever his ideas are brought-up.

## Economists in the Gilded Age 

Did any respectful economist sound the alarm? In an era we now view as having manufactured monopolies, exploitation, and incredible inequality. Did any economist see a problem with what was going on? Was there no cognitive dissonance at all? The reactions the economic orthodox would've given then was something like this: 

- J.P. Morgan wasn't bad he was just an enterprising individual.
- Wow look the jobs all of these magnates are creating.
- Look at the free market doing its thing.
- The people who made it to the top were just better market competitors.
- People have to right to use their money however they want to.

I mean to really get a sense of the economic zeitgeist, look no further than Yale's 1st economist William Graham Sumner. Here is a quote from his 1883 book "What Social Classes Owe to Each Other":

> Hence, those who today enjoy the most complete emancipation from the hardships of human life, and the greatest command over the conditions of existence, simply show us the best that man has yet been able to do. Can we all reach that standard by wishing for it? Can we all vote it to each other? If we pull down those who are most for-tunate and successful, shall we not by that very act defeat our own object? (What Social Classes Owe to Each Other)

There's already a clear undertone of Social Darwinism there. But it does make sense when you are considering the doctrine of liberalism. Free individual -> Free Markets -> Laisezz Faire. So really, who cares about the people that "failed"? It's the impersonal mechanisms of the market, sucks for you, but not for me. 

** Note: The more modern debate on this topic is the concept of Meritocracy, see the similarities?

This dogmatism is why I thought it'd be fun to examine what occured during the Gilded Age in light of it. Stepping back a bit. There definitely were dissenters like Veblin and the such, but the dominating intellectual forces gravitated towards apathy and minutiae. I think I have made my point on economics ability to enable cruelty clear.I want to move on to the more visceral and narrative argument against indexing the soul towards the profit motive.

## Rich Shenanigans

> It was not only in their neglect of the fine processes of the law that the Americans outdid their European contemporaries; when they fought, they abandoned the gentleman’s rapier for the roughneck’s brass knuckles (The Worldly Philosophers)

This section tells the many, almost absurd tales, that went on during the age of riches and expansion.

#### Black Friday

The Black Friday we know well of today stems from the schemes of two magnates James Fisk and Jay Gould. Our modern-day experience of Black Friday is one of sales and cheap goods which benefits all consumers. The initial Black Friday was much more grim and had severe negative impacts on the American economy because the good devalued then was gold. So how did the gold crash and economic downturn come about? It rose from the desire and ability to financially manipulate the markets.

In the Gilded Ages, the United States was tied to the gold standard. The duo took advantage of the gold standard and devised a scheme to corner to gold market. The idea is, especially in a commodity market where there is significant demand, if they control the supply they can artificially inflate the price to their desired price levels. They also knew a little something about informational assymettry so they had to come up with a plan to execute their enters and exits anonymously. On top of that, they knew the government had gold reserves and was willing to prevent their cornerning of the gold market by selling their reserves at normal market prices.

Long-story short, they bribed a guy name Daniel Butterfield to kill two birds with one stone. Because Butterfield was the one executing trades for the U.S. government, he could provide intel to Fisk and Gould on any potential market transactions before it was done. The duo would also buy up gold in Butterfield's name as a way to cover their tracks. But, nothing really escapes the U.S. government. President Grant and his secrety of treasury pieced together their scheme and did what the duo was scared of; On September 24th 1869, Black Friday occured. The treasury sold off $4 million in gold to the market and the price of gold dipped which affected the price of many goods like wheat which went from $1.40 to $.77 a bushel.

** Note: This is an interesting case for nominal/real value, monetary theory, and the gold standard here that I want to dig into a bit more later.

#### The Original Pump & Dump Scheme

This tale depicts the godfather of all crypto pump and dump schemes. The use of social status / trust, inflating the price of a meaningless thing (token/stocks), and then pulling the rug on buyers to exit with a pretty hefty profit. But instead of crypto bros or Youtubers being scummy, it was the working of William Rockefeller, the brother of John D. Rockefeller. And instead of a newly minted cryptocurreny or nfts, it was the shares of a newly created company called the Amalgamated Copper Company. 

** Note: Kind of like if Jake Paul made a crypto scheme instead of Logan Paul.

Here were the steps:

1. Rogers and Rockefeller gave a check for $39 million to Marcus Daly for the Anaconda
properties, on the condition that he would deposit it in the National City Bank and leave it
untouched for a specified period.

2. They then set up a paper organization known as the Amalgamated Copper Company, with their
own clerks as dummy directors, and caused Amalgamated to buy Anaconda—not for cash, but
for $75 million in Amalgamated stock which was conveniently printed for the purpose.

3. From the National City Bank, Rogers and Rockefeller now borrowed $39 million to cover the
check they had given to Marcus Daly, and as collateral for this loan they used the $75 million
in Amalgamated stock.

4. They now sold the Amalgamated stock on the market (first having touted it through their
brokers) for $75 million.

5. With the proceeds, they retired the $39-million loan from the National City Bank, and pocketed
$36 million as their own profit on the deal.

The investors were very much duped and they made out with a pretty hefty amount of money. $36 million is nominally now would be around $1.3 billion dollars. Although maybe it wasn't as bad as the crypto schemes of today. Amalgamated Copper Company actually had an underlying market and real cash flows which was in the mining and minerals industry. So you could argue that even though the investors got the short-end in the short-run, on the long-run (100 years), they should be thanking them for providing the investment opportunity.

** Note: I remember a funny bit in a lecture that said a good way to make money is become a fraud journalist, report a company to the SEC, and then short the stock.

#### An Excerpt from The Wordly Philosophers

The book actually gave me the idea to write this blog post and this excerpt in particular was interesting:

>In this mêlée for industrial supremacy no quarter was asked and none given. Even dynamite had its uses, being employed to eliminate one particularly sticky competitor of the Standard Oil group, while less violent means, such as kidnapping, were remarkable more for their ingenuity than for their immorality. In 1881, when a great blizzard blew down the telegraph lines in New York, Jay Gould, the ruthless master of the money markets, was forced to send his orders to his broker by messenger. His enemies saw their chance and acted on it: they kidnapped the boy, substituted another of the same general physiognomy, and for several weeks Gould was dismayed to find that his moves were all somehow known to his adversaries in advance. (The Wordly Philosophers)

#### Political Corruption

This definitely happened and there are so many documentation of these events happening. I'm being intellectualy lazy by not showing these, but please don't be intellectually dishonest in say political corruption was not a thing. I added this section moreso to highlight the double standard that exists in the practical liberal framework. Economics can impact politics through bribing, buyouts, and super-pacs while politics have clearly nothing to do with economics to the extent that they should uphold "fundamental" rights.


# Philantrophists or Robber Barons

I spent the most of blog dunking on these magnates, but I actually want to highlight maybe some of the good they have done in their lives. Many of these magnates went on to distribute their wealth that went towards education. An example of two schools formed directly due to such substantial donations is Carnegie Mellon Univeristy and the University of Chicago (Rockefeller). Carnegie is a magnate who embodies the dilemma of philantrophists. Andrew Carnegie got rich off of the drew industry and gained the same riches as his contemporaries did by exploiting the labor of workers, market manipulation, lobbying for tariffs, and buying out competition.

The most major blight on his record was the Homestead Strike that occured under Carnegie's leadership. Workers wanted to organize into a union and demand fairer pay for the working conditions in the steel mills. The strike led to the state guard coming in and shutting down the strike. But here is the kicker, Carnegie was not the one officially leading at that time. He was off away in Scotland to oversee the construction of his castle. Henry Frick was put in charge and Carnegie did distance himself from the violence, but never said anything privately. On an even more confusing note, Carnegie wrote "The Gospel of Wealth". A book which ran counter to Sumner's ideas and explicitly said this:

> Those who have greatly accumulated wealth have a duty to give back to society. (The Gospel of Wealth)

And he was a man of his word. Carnegie ended up donating 90% of his estate to public facing institutions. I chose Carnegie because his story to me is the most compelling for capitalism. It seems that at the end of his life, Carnegie came to realize the fundamental liberal doctrine of pursuing wealth was that it makes humanity better-off.Which is why to me, it makes it hard to judge him as a historical figure. However, I think it is accurate to say that in the sum whole of Carnegie's life he was both a philantropist and a robber baron.

Though the life of Andrew Carnegie was full of contradictions, he embodied the tension between industrial ambition and social responsibility. Though he amassed great wealth through practices that often exploited workers, he later advocated for the ethical obligation of the wealthy to give back to society. Though he sought to elevate society through his extensive donations, the methods he used to accumulate his fortune raised questions about the means justifying the ends. Ultimately, though Carnegie's story reflects the complexities of capitalism, it also highlights the potential for personal transformation and a commitment to the greater good.

I want to leave off the blog with a question for you to consider:

What do you think of Bill Gates and the Bill Gates Foundation?
