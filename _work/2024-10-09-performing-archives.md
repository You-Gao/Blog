# NOAA Climate Data Records

I want to explore the archive of climate data and excavate it's other names through the performance of film. I say excavate because performance allows you to reveal the different names of an archive by providing different vantage points into it. Depending on how you look at a collection of climate, the material data can conceive a plurality of archives. An ecological economist could see it as an archive of market failures, a environmental scientist could see it as an archive of the earth's climate, or a tin-foilist could see it as an archive of state lies. By theorizing about archives that way, I argue that performance then is a form of pedagogy. Performance gives the performers viewpoint of the archive; which is achieved through the materiality and how it invokes the memories of the archive. In my case, film allows me to intervene on the archive's conception as historical climate data and modify it's name to become an archive of pressing climate problems. Given a time where the public sees data through a very static and empirical lens, it is important to show that climate data is not simply the measurement with precision sensors, but also deeply implicated in the political, the social, and the economical.

## Performing Archives 

The most abstract, but still functional defintion of archives is any "concept" with a "history" in relation to material(s). That is, the fundamental pieces that makes an archive is a memory function and a historical function. For example, the Ginko tree near the Chapel is apart of an archive of place. Whether that be UVA, Charlottesville, or USA, the Ginko tree is apart of those archives. In my definition I say materials and not bodies because to me, an archive encapsules a collection of usually extracted, externalized knowledge. Going back to Diana Taylor, I find it funny to find myself at full loop in the course as she also wrote: 

> The fact that archival memory succeeds in separating the source of ‘‘knowledge’’ from the knower—in time and/or space —leads to comments, such as de Certeau’s, that it is ‘‘expansionist’’ and ‘‘immunized against alterity’'

The strongest implication from the definition is that there is a normalizing force in archives and archival knowledge. A lot of the readings we covered throughout the class is precisely talking about how the archives are misused as tools that legitimize narratives. Epistemological violence is a word used often when questioning an archive because they are not static. Knowledge production and especially storage of knowledge, is socially implicated. That is why we covered concepts like refugee epistemology, the repertoire, and visceral logics precisely because archives, for better or worse, are created and interfaced with by people. In asking and answering "What is an archive?", I ask myself "What are archives?", and from class the answer is that archives have been historically/presently tools that legitimize and reify logics of ideological dogmatism.

Going back on my definition earlier, I wanted to give some clarifying examples of what I mean by: "any concept with a history". What that means is, an archive is always an archive of something. And to reiterate another the point: "materials can conceive for many archives". For instance, archives can be related to collections of documents, artifacts, stories, or memories. But when considering what can be archived, even the concept of a nation, a community, or an event can have so.[^2] However, not all concepts get memorialized and not all materials archived. 

Taking a look at indigenious oral storytelling, it can be said that their stories contains many archives. Archives of Sky Women, Sweetgrass, and the Land. [^1] Not only that, indigenious modes of being open-up new archives by changing what valid sources of information are: the body, the land, the life.

> Breathe in its scent and you start to remember things you didn’t know you’d forgotten. Our elders say that ceremonies are the way we “remember to remember,”

[^1] Mar de Vang's intervention into the state archives is an example of how "materials can conceive for many archives". She demonstrates how state documents were not a neutral archive on Hmong peoples, but how the archive's had another being as an archive of Hmong violence. Archive(s) conceive from the things that is said and not said, found or forgotten, material and immaterial, signifier and signified.

Then the performance modifier of performing archives acts as a pedagogical function that gives knowledge of and neccessarily modifies the archives. A phrase often used and is good description in explaining performance, is that each way of performing offers a way into the archive. The difference in method changes the materiality in how you come to know the archive, but the sum total memory stays the same regardless of methodology. Though, the different methods can illuminate different memories the archive holds to each of their strong suits. A clarifying example is Christina Sharpe's "Wake Work" and how she uses it to approach the afterlives/archives of slavery. The substance and material here is the approach as a way of coming into knowing and reclaiming history. She writes:

> the precarities of the ongoing disaster of the ruptures of chattel slavery. They texture my reading practices, my ways of being in and of the world, my relations with and to others.

Material invokes the archives, begs you to recall its imprinted memories, guides you towards what was lost, surrogates for knowledge.

## Film as Performance 

Film as a method like any other is able to provide additional information that contextualizes the archive. These methods of adding more information through the materiality is dependent on the method, but for Film in particular I think the fundamental operations are that of layering and cutting. The memory that an archive evokes can litteraly be implanted into the performance via splicing in visual and auditory information, while the materiality/texture is how the experience of the film gets structured. The ways layering different sounds, spicing information, and creates a narrative structure for how the archive is experienced. Through how the editor edits, they creates a curated experience into the archive via the visual tensions, temporal senses, and sound collages. Film can takeclimate record archives with its normative conceptions and change how the archive is itself interpreted.

## Climate Discourse Needs Fresh Eyes 

I chose NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association) Climate Archives as it seems the world is once again coming to critical mass on the topic of climate change. The problem is the old narratives have not succeeded or "feasibly" brought us to a world where the climate isn't a looming problem. Narratives from green economists, scientific researchers, and most importantly, politicians; have not actually changed the way we relate to the climate. I mean, even having went to a environmental governor school; I still kind of roll my eyes when I see the CO2 chart. Not to the data, but the political economic discourse faced in the light of its implications. To counter such apathy, even my own, I look towards ecological fIlm in particular as it has the power to show something raw; bare nature is something that can't be refuted. Also, what time better to do this work than now? The Sahara has been flooded, Mathematically improbable hurricanes are common-place, and day after day during Summer the Earth experienced record-breaking temperatures. If not now when?

## Conclusion/Justification

> To my teacher because, I was supposed to write this as a standard paper. Hope this is okay!

Throughout the blog, I have talked about the nature of archives: what is and what are, the powers of peforming and performance, and how they are connected to memory and materiality. In a traditional paper, I would continue on to write and talk of the plentitude of ways I can use film performance to disrupt the normative conception of climatological archives. I would continue to talk on why it is apt and neccessary for performance to be applied in providing new insights into the archives. The thing I wouldn't be doing is actually making the film. So, here is the short-film experience I created. 

### Creative Process

> This does not have to be graded

One of the most important things I whenever working with information is ensuring I am honest to what I'm displaying. I think back to a class I took in the School of Architecture: SARC 5400 - Data Visualization and particularly Tufte's principles of information integrity.[] The first 5 is about causality, relationships, multivariateness, evidence, and what is the question? These principles can be mapped to doing information work in films like considering what are the thematic objects, their ontological relations, the layered political, economical, human dimensions, but I think the strongest element for me was documenting each clip. The 6th principle is about owning and documenting the information. So for that I wanted to actually document the cost, etc, to each clip, but I realized it would be unfeasible as I was already layering 3 things on top of each other as the years past on. 

[]: My final project actually can be thought as performing global archives as well: :

I did a lot of media studies self-study and reflection from everything I have seen and watched. I had to go and learn Davinci Resolve, but using the tools to create the video was easier than I thought it would have been.

The thing with creation is that you learn more in the process of performing than the end performance that is generated. I think after working through a project like this I can definitively say the teacher learns more than the student. Another phrasing is that writing something, performing something, and creating an useless end product, IS still productive and generative. I mean thats why I made this blog, is so I delve deeper and sort of force myself to reflect upon things I come across: blog as pedagogy.

THE hardest thing I am currently facing in finishing the short-film is the problem of scope. I originally set out to accomplish one-task related to my definitions of archive and performance. That task is showing how the climate archives, particularly the ones invoked by scientists, has other names. Because if you only see climate records as an archive of climate (which is debated), you miss out on any other ways of experiencing or interfacing with the records. Latour would say you are othering yourself from the processes of knowledge creation.
