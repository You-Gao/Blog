# NOAA Climate Data Records

For my paper I want to explore the archive of climate data and excavate it's other names through the performance of film. I say excavate because performance allows you to call forth the different names of an archive by providing different vantage points into it. Depending on how you look the collection of climate data can serve as archives of many things. An ecological economist could see it as an archive of market failures, a environmental scientist could see it as an archive of the earth's climate, or a tin-foilist could see it as an archive of the deep state's lies. In my case, film allows me to intervene on the archive's conception as historical climate data and modify it's name to become the archive of humanities biggest problems. Given a time where the public sees data through a very static and empirical lens, it is important to show that climate data is not simply the measurement with precision sensors, but also deeply connected with the political, the social, and the economical.

## Performing Archives 

The most abstract concept I can define archives with is any "concept" with a "history". That is the fundamental pieces that create an archive is a memory function and a historical function. But, the strongest implication from this abstract definition is that there is a normalizing force in archives and archival knowledge. A lot of the readings we cover throughout the class is precisely talking about how the archives are misused as tools that legitimize narratives. That is why we covered concepts like refugee epistemology, the repertoire, and visceral logics precisely because archive's are created and interfaced with by people. In asking "What is an archive?", it would be dishonest for me to address "What are archives?", and from class the answer is that archives have been historically/presently tools that legitimize and reify ideological structures like colonialism, imperialism, capitalism, etc.

[make the text on-click highlight definition]

Going back on my broader definition earlier, I wanted to give some clarifying examples of what I mean by: "any concept with a history". What that means is, an archive is always an archive of something. For instance, archives can be collections of documents, artifacts, stories, or memories. But at a more abstract level, even the concept of a nation, a community, or an event can be seen as having an archiveâ€”a record or body of knowledge that is connected to its history, continuously shaped by memory, and bound by the power structures that define how that history is told. Taking a look at indigenious immaterial archives, it can be said that their oral storytelling contains many archives. Archives of Sky Women, Sweetgrass, and the Land. Not only that, indigenious modes of being open-up new archives to gather information from just by changing what valid sources of information are. [^1] Mar de Vang's intervention into the state archives demonstrated how it was not just a corpus of state information on Hmong bodies (an archive of Hmong state information), but how the archive itself was an archive of Hmong violence. Archive(s) conceive from the things that is said and not said, found or forgotten, material and immaterial.

Then the performance modifier of performing archive, really acts as a pedagogical function. A phrase often used and I think a really good description is that each way of performing offers a way into the archive. The difference in method changes the materiality in how you come to know the archive; the sum total memory stays the same regardless of methodology, but different methods can illuminate different memories the archive holds to their strong suits. Material invokes the archives, begs you to recall its imprinted memories, guides you towards what was lost, surrogates for knowledge.


## Film as Performance 

Film as a method like any other is able to provide additional information that contextualizes the archive. These methods of adding more information through the materiality is dependent on the method, but for Film in particular I think the fundamental operations are that of layering and cutting. The memory that an archive evokes can litteraly be implanted into the performance via splicing in visual and auditory information, while the materiality/texture is how the experience of the film gets structured. The ways layering different sounds, spicing information, and then how all of that which creates a narrative structure. Through how the editor edits, they creates a curated experience into the archives via the visual tensions, temporal senses, and sound collages. Film can take something like climate archives, apolitical, historical, and in a very clear way changes how the archive is itself conceived.

## Climate Needs a New Narrative

I chose to do Film and Climate because I think it is critical to bring up again to the social consciousness. Things like short-form content also do really well nowadays, but I think the technical aspects of performing through film is at an even more important precipice. We all see ecology through sensationalized news, but that leads a lot down the path of desensitization, political ignorance, and not generally not caring. Ecological FIlm in particular has the power to show something raw; bare nature is something that can't be refuted. Conceptually, the goal is to deliver this clear intervention and offer a new perspective against the desensitization. I mean, even I as having completed an associates in Environmental Science, kind of roll my eyes when I see the CO2 chart because I have been admissive, not to the data, but the political economic discourse faced in the light of it. Also, what time better to do this work than now? The Sahara has been flooded, Mathematically improbable hurricanes are common-place, and day after day during Summer the Earth experienced record-breaking temperatures. If not now when?

## Conclusion/Justification

> More to my teacher because, I was supposed to write this as a standard paper. Hope this is okay!

Throughout the blog, I have talked about the nature of archives: what is and what are, the powers of peforming and performance, and how they are connected to memory and materiality. In a traditional paper, I would continue on to write and talk of the plentitude of ways I can use film performance to disrupt the normative conception of climatological archives. I would continue to talk on why it is apt and neccessary for performance to be applied in providing new insights into the archives. The thing I wouldn't be doing is actually making the film. So, here is the short-film experience I created. 

### Creative Process

> This does not have to be graded

One of the most important things I whenever working with information is ensuring I am honest to what I'm displaying. I think back to a class I took in the School of Architecture: SARC 5400 - Data Visualization and particularly Tufte's principles of information integrity.[] The first 5 is about causality, relationships, multivariateness, evidence, and what is the question? These principles can be mapped to doing information work in films like considering what are the thematic objects, their ontological relations, the layered political, economical, human dimensions, but I think the strongest element for me was documenting each clip. The 6th principle is about owning and documenting the information; by naming my sources via just writing the name, year, deaths, and damages, it deeply grounds those elements. 

[]: My final project actually can be thought as performing global archives as well: :

I did a lot of media studies self-study and relfection from everything I have seen and watched. I had to go and learn Davinci Resolve, but using the tools to create the video was easier than I thought it would have been.

The thing with creation is that you learn more in the process of performing than the end performance that is generated. I think after working through a project like this I can definitively say the teacher learns more than the student. Another phrasing is that writing something, performing something, and creating an useless end product, IS still productive and generative. I mean thats why I made this blog, is so I delve deeper and sort of force myself to reflect upon things I come across: blog as pedagogy.
